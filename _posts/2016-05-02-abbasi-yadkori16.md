title: A Fast and Reliable Policy Improvement Algorithm
abstract: We introduce a simple, efficient method that improves stochastic policies
  for Markov decision processes.  The computational complexity is the same as that
  of the value estimation problem.  We prove that when the value estimation error
  is small, this method gives an improvement in performance that increases with certain
  variance properties of the initial policy and transition dynamics.  Performance
  in numerical experiments compares favorably with previous policy improvement algorithms.
