title: 'Tensor vs. Matrix Methods: Robust Tensor Decomposition under Block Sparse
  Perturbations'
abstract: Robust tensor CP decomposition involves decomposing  a tensor into low rank
  and sparse components. We propose a novel non-convex iterative algorithm with guaranteed
  recovery.  It alternates  between  low-rank CP decomposition through gradient ascent
  (a variant of the tensor power method), and  hard thresholding of the residual.
  We prove convergence to the globally optimal solution   under natural incoherence
  conditions on the low rank component, and bounded level of sparse perturbations.
  We compare our method with natural baselines, which apply robust  matrix PCA either
  to the \em flattened tensor, or to the matrix slices of the tensor. Our method can
  provably handle a far greater level of perturbation  when the sparse  tensor is  block-structured.
  This naturally occurs in many applications such as  the foreground-background separation
  task in videos. Our experiments validate these findings. Thus, we establish that
  tensor methods can tolerate  a higher level of gross corruptions compared to matrix
  methods.
