title: 'Bipartite Correlation Clustering: Maximizing Agreements'
abstract: 'In Bipartite Correlation Clustering (BCC)  we are given a complete bipartite
  graph G with ’+’ and ’-’ edges, and we seek a vertex clustering that maximizes the
  number of agreements: the number of all ’+’ edges within clusters plus all ’-’ edges
  cut across clusters. BCC is known to be NP-hard [5].  We present a novel approximation
  algorithm for k-BCC, a variant of BCC with an upper bound k on the number of clusters.
  Our algorithm outputs a k-clustering that provably achieves a number of agreements
  within a multiplicative (1-δ)-factor from the optimal, for any desired accuracy
  δ. It relies on solving a combinatorially constrained bilinear maximization on the
  bi-adjacency matrix of G. It runs in time exponential in k and 1/δ, but linear in
  the size of the input.  Further, we show that, in the (unconstrained) BCC setting,
  an (1-δ)-approximation can be achieved by O(1/δ) clusters regardless of the size
  of the graph. In turn, our k-BCC algorithm implies an Efficient PTAS for the BCC
  objective of maximizing agreements.'
