title: Pareto Front Identification from Stochastic Bandit Feedback
abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the Pareto front for multiple objectives
  from a finite set of operating points. Sampling an operating point gives a random
  vector where each coordinate corresponds to the value of one of the objectives.
  The Pareto front is the set of operating points that are not dominated by any other
  operating point in respect to all objectives (considering the mean of their objective
  values). We propose a confidence bound algorithm to approximate the Pareto front,
  and prove problem specific lower and upper bounds, showing that the sample complexity
  is characterized by some natural geometric properties of the operating points. Experiments
  confirm the reliability of our algorithm. For the problem of finding a sparse cover
  of the Pareto front, we propose an asymmetric covering algorithm of independent
  interest.
