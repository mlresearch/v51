title: Probabilistic Approximate Least-Squares
abstract: Least-squares and kernel-ridge / Gaussian process regression are among the
  foundational algorithms of statistics and machine learning. Famously, the worst-case
  cost of exact nonparametric regression grows cubically with the data-set size; but
  a growing number of approximations have been developed that estimate good solutions
  at lower cost. These algorithms typically return point estimators, without measures
  of uncertainty. Leveraging recent results casting elementary linear algebra operations
  as probabilistic inference, we propose a new approximate method for nonparametric
  least-squares that affords a probabilistic uncertainty estimate over the error between
  the approximate and exact least-squares solution (this is not the same as the posterior
  variance of the associated Gaussian process regressor). This allows estimating the
  error of the least-squares solution on a subset of the data relative to the full-data
  solution.  The uncertainty can be used to control the computational effort invested
  in the approximation. Our algorithm has linear cost in the data-set size, and a
  simple formal form, so that it can be implemented with a few lines of code in programming
  languages with linear algebra functionality.
