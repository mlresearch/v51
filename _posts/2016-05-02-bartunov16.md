title: Breaking Sticks and Ambiguities with Adaptive Skip-gram
abstract: The recently proposed Skip-gram model is a powerful method for learning
  high-dimensional word representations that capture rich semantic relationships between
  words. However, Skip-gram as well as most prior work on learning word representations
  does not take into account word ambiguity and maintain only single representation
  per word. Although a number of Skip-gram modifications were proposed to overcome
  this limitation and learn multi-prototype word representations, they either require
  a known number of word meanings or learn them using greedy heuristic approaches.
  In this paper we propose the Adaptive Skip-gram model which is a nonparametric Bayesian
  extension of Skip-gram capable to automatically learn the required number of representations
  for all words at desired semantic resolution. We derive efficient online variational
  learning algorithm for the model and empirically demonstrate its efficiency on word-sense
  induction task.
