title: Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo via Spectral Clustering
abstract: As it has become common to use many computer cores in routine applications,
  finding good ways to parallelize popular algorithms has become increasingly important.
  In this paper, we present a parallelization scheme for Markov chain Monte Carlo
  (MCMC) methods based on spectral clustering of the underlying state space, generalizing
  earlier work on parallelization of MCMC methods by state space partitioning. We
  show empirically that this approach speeds up MCMC sampling for multimodal distributions
  and that it can be usefully applied in greater generality than several related algorithms.
  Our algorithm converges under reasonable conditions to an ‘optimal’ MCMC algorithm.
  We also show that our approach can be asymptotically far more efficient than naive
  parallelization, even in situations such as completely flat target distributions
  where no unique optimal algorithm exists. Finally, we combine theoretical and empirical
  bounds to provide practical guidance on the choice of tuning parameters.
