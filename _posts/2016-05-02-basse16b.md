title: Randomization and The Pernicious Effects of Limited Budgets on Auction Experiments
abstract: Buyers (e.g., advertisers) often have limited financial or   processing
  resources, and so their participation in auctions is   throttled. Changes to auctions
  may affect bids or throttling, and   any change may affect what buyers pay. This
  paper shows that if an   A/B experiment affects only bids, then the observed treatment
  effect   is an unbiased estimator when all the bidders in the same auction   are
  randomly assigned to A or B but the observed treatment effect   can be severely
  biased otherwise, even in the absence of   throttling. Experiments that affect throttling
  algorithms can also   be badly biased, but the bias can be much reduced if separate   budgets
  are maintained for the A and B arms of the experiment.
