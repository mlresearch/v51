title: Consistently Estimating Markov Chains with Noisy Aggregate Data
abstract: We address the problem of estimating the parameters of a time-homogeneous
  Markov chain given only noisy, aggregate data. This arises when a population of
  individuals behave independently according to a Markov chain, but individual sample
  paths cannot be observed due to limitations of the observation process or the need
  to protect privacy. Instead, only population-level counts of the number of individuals
  in each state at each time step are available. When these counts are exact, a conditional
  least squares (CLS) estimator is known to be consistent and asymptotically normal.
  We initiate the study of method of moments estimators for this problem to handle
  the more realistic case when observations are additionally corrupted by noise. We
  show that CLS can be interpreted as a simple “plug-in” method of moments estimator.
  However, when observations are noisy, it is not consistent because it fails to account
  for additional variance introduced by the noise. We develop a new, simpler method
  of moments estimator that bypasses this problem and is consistent under noisy observations.
