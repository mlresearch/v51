title: Geometry Aware Mappings for High Dimensional Sparse Factors
abstract: While matrix factorisation models are ubiquitous in large scale recommendation
  and search, real time application of such models requires inner product computations
  over an intractably large set of item factors. In this manuscript we present a novel
  framework that exploits structural properties of sparse vectors, using the inverted
  index representation, to significantly reduce the run time computational cost of
  factorisation models. We develop techniques that use geometry aware permutation
  maps on a tessellated unit sphere to obtain high dimensional sparse embeddings for
  latent factors with sparsity patterns related to angular closeness of the original
  latent factors. We also design several efficient and deterministic realisations
  within this framework and demonstrate with experiments that our techniques lead
  to faster run time operation with minimal loss of accuracy.
