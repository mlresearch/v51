title: Supervised Neighborhoods for Distributed Nonparametric Regression
abstract: Techniques for nonparametric regression based on fitting small-scale local
  models at prediction time have long been studied in statistics and pattern recognition,
  but have received less attention in modern large-scale machine learning applications.
  In practice, such methods are generally applied to low-dimensional problems, but
  may falter with high-dimensional predictors if they use a Euclidean distance-based
  kernel. We propose a new method, SILO, for fitting prediction-time local models
  that uses supervised neighborhoods that adapt to the local shape of the regression
  surface. To learn such neighborhoods, we use a weight function between points derived
  from random forests. We prove the consistency of SILO, and demonstrate through simulations
  and real data that our method works well in both the serial and distributed settings.
  In the latter case, SILO learns the weighting function in a divide-and-conquer manner,
  entirely avoiding communication at training time.
