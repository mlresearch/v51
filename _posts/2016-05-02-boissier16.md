title: Fast Convergence of Online Pairwise Learning Algorithms
abstract: Pairwise learning usually refers to a learning task which involves a loss
  function depending on pairs of examples, among which most notable ones are bipartite
  ranking, metric learning and AUC maximization.  In this paper, we focus on online
  learning algorithms for pairwise learning problems without strong convexity, for
  which all previously known algorithms achieve a convergence rate of \mathcalO(1/\sqrtT)
  after T iterations. In particular, we study an online learning algorithm for pairwise
  learning with a least-square loss function in an unconstrained setting.  We prove
  that the convergence of its last iterate can converge to the desired minimizer at
  a rate arbitrarily close to \mathcalO(1/T) up to logarithmic factor.  The rates
  for this algorithm are established in high probability under the assumptions of
  polynomially decaying step sizes.
