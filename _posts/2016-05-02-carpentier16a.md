title: Revealing Graph Bandits for Maximizing Local Influence
abstract: We study a graph bandit setting where the objective of the learner is to
  detect the most influential node of a graph by requesting as little information
  from the graph as possible.  One of the relevant applications for this setting is
  marketing in social networks, where the marketer aims at finding and taking advantage
  of the most influential customers. The existing approaches for bandit problems on
  graphs require either partial or complete knowledge of the graph. In this paper,
  we do not assume any knowledge of the graph, but we consider a setting where it
  can be gradually discovered in a sequential and active way. At each round, the learner
  chooses a node of the graph and the only information it receives is a stochastic
  set of the nodes that the chosen node is currently influencing.  To address this
  setting, we propose BARE, a bandit strategy for which we prove a regret guarantee
  that scales with the detectable dimension, a problem dependent quantity that is
  often much smaller than the number of nodes.
