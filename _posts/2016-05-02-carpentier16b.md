title: Learning Relationships between Data Obtained Independently
abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a new method for learning the relationships
  between data that have been obtained independently. Unlike existing methods like
  matching, the proposed technique does not require any contextual information, provided
  that the dependency between the variables of interest is monotone. It can therefore
  be easily combined with matching in order to exploit the advantages of both methods.
  This technique can be described as a mix between quantile matching, and deconvolution.
  We provide for it a theoretical and an empirical validation.
