title: Multi-Level Cause-Effect Systems
abstract: We present a domain-general account of causation that applies to settings
  in which macro-level causal relations between two systems are of interest, but the
  relevant causal features are poorly understood and have to be aggregated from vast
  arrays of micro-measurements. Our approach generalizes that of Chalupka et. al.
  (2015) to the setting in which the macro-level effect is not specified. We formalize
  the connection between micro- and macro-variables in such situations and provide
  a coherent framework describing causal relations at multiple levels of analysis.
  We present an algorithm that discovers macro-variable causes and effects from micro-level
  measurements obtained from an experiment. We further show how to design experiments
  to discover macro-variables from observational micro-variable data. Finally, we
  show that under specific conditions, one can identify multiple levels of causal
  structure. Throughout the article, we use a simulated neuroscience multi-unit recording
  experiment to illustrate the ideas and the algorithms.
