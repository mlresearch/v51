title: A Robust-Equitable Copula Dependence Measure for Feature Selection
abstract: 'Feature selection aims to select relevant features to improve the performance
  of predictors. Many feature selection methods depend on the choice of dependence
  measures. To select features that have complex nonlinear relationships with the
  response variable, the dependence measure should be equitable: treating linear and
  nonlinear relationships equally. In this paper we introduce the concept of robust-equitability
  and a robust-equitable dependence measure copula correlation (Ccor). This measure
  has the following advantages compared to existing dependence measures: it is robust
  to different relationship forms and robust to unequal sample sizes of different
  features. In contrast, existing dependence measures cannot take these factors into
  account simultaneously. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm
  our theoretical analysis, and illustrates its advantage in feature selection.'
