title: Online Learning to Rank with Feedback at the Top
abstract: We consider an online learning to rank setting in which, at each round,
  an oblivious adversary generates a list of m documents, pertaining to a query, and
  the learner ranks the documents according to assigned scores. The adversary then
  generates a relevance vector and the learner updates its ranker according to the
  feedback received. We consider the setting where the feedback is restricted to be
  the relevance levels of only the top k documents in the ranked list, for k â‰ªm. However,
  the performance of learner is judged based on the unrevealed full relevance vectors,
  using an appropriate learning to rank loss function. We develop efficient algorithms
  for well known losses in the pointwise, pairwise and listwise families. We also
  prove that no online algorithm can have sublinear regret, with top 1 feedback, for
  any loss that is calibrated with respect to NDCG. We apply our algorithms on benchmark
  datasets demonstrating efficient online learning of a ranking function from highly
  restricted feedback.
