title: Enumerating Equivalence Classes of Bayesian Networks using EC Graphs
abstract: We consider the problem of learning Bayesian network structures from complete
  data.  In particular, we consider the enumeration of their k-best equivalence classes.  We
  propose a new search space for A* search, called the EC graph, that facilitates
  the enumeration of equivalence classes, by representing the space of completed,
  partially directed acyclic graphs.  We also propose a canonization of this search
  space, called the EC tree, which further improves the efficiency of enumeration.  Empirically,
  our approach is orders of magnitude more efficient than the state-of-the-art at
  enumerating equivalence classes.
