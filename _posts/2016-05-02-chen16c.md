title: Bridging the Gap between Stochastic Gradient MCMC and Stochastic Optimization
abstract: 'Stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) methods are Bayesian
  analogs to popular stochastic optimization methods; however, this connection is
  not well studied. We explore this relationship by applying simulated annealing to
  an SG-MCMC algorithm. Furthermore, we extend recent SG-MCMC methods with two key
  components: i) adaptive preconditioners (as in ADAgrad or RMSprop), and ii) adaptive
  element-wise momentum weights. The zero-temperature limit gives a novel stochastic
  optimization method with adaptive element-wise momentum weights, while conventional
  optimization methods only have a shared, static momentum weight. Under certain assumptions,
  our theoretical analysis suggests the proposed simulated annealing approach converges
  close to the global optima. Experiments on several deep neural network models show
  state-of-the-art results compared to related stochastic optimization algorithms.'
