title: Robust Covariate Shift Regression
abstract: In many learning settings, the source data available to train a regression
  model differs from the target data it encounters when making predictions due to
  input distribution shift. Appropriately dealing with this situation remains an important
  challenge. Existing methods attempt to “reweight” the source data samples to better
  represent the target domain, but this introduces strong inductive biases that are
  highly extrapolative and can often err greatly in practice. We propose a robust
  approach for regression under covariate shift that embraces the uncertainty resulting
  from sample selection bias by producing regression models that are explicitly robust
  to it. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on a number of regression tasks.
