title: Communication Efficient Distributed Agnostic Boosting
abstract: We consider the problem of learning from distributed data in the agnostic
  setting, i.e., in the presence of arbitrary forms of noise. Our main contribution
  is a general distributed boosting-based procedure for learning an arbitrary concept
  space, that is simultaneously noise tolerant, communication efficient, and computationally
  efficient. This improves significantly over prior works that were either communication
  efficient only in noise-free scenarios or computationally prohibitive. Empirical
  results on large synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
  and scalability of the proposed approach.
