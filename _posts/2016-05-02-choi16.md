title: Fast and Scalable Structural SVM with Slack Rescaling
abstract: We present an efficient method for training slack-rescaled   structural
  SVM. Although finding the most violating label in a   margin-rescaled formulation
  is often easy since the target function   decomposes with respect to the structure,
  this is not the case for a   slack-rescaled formulation, and finding the most violated
  label   might be very difficult.  Our core contribution is an efficient   method
  for finding the most-violating-label in a slack-rescaled   formulation, given an
  oracle that returns the most-violating-label   in a (slightly modified) margin-rescaled
  formulation.  We show that   our method enables accurate and scalable training for
  slack-rescaled   SVMs, reducing runtime by an order of magnitude compared to previous
  approaches to slack-rescaled SVMs.
