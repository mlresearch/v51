title: Score Permutation Based Finite Sample Inference for Generalized AutoRegressive
  Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) Models
abstract: A standard model of (conditional) heteroscedasticity, i.e., the phenomenon
  that the variance of a process changes over time, is the Generalized AutoRegressive
  Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, which is especially important for
  economics and finance. GARCH models are typically estimated by the Quasi-Maximum
  Likelihood (QML) method, which works under mild statistical assumptions. Here, we
  suggest a finite sample approach, called ScoPe, to construct distribution-free confidence
  regions around the QML estimate, which have exact coverage probabilities, despite
  no additional assumptions about moments are made. ScoPe is inspired by the recently
  developed Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) method, which however cannot be applied in the  GARCH
  case. ScoPe works by perturbing the score function using randomly permuted residuals.
  This produces alternative samples which lead to exact confidence regions. Experiments
  on simulated and stock market data are also presented, and ScoPe is compared with
  the asymptotic theory and bootstrap approaches.
