title: 'Simple and Scalable Constrained Clustering: a Generalized Spectral Method'
abstract: We present a simple spectral approach to the well-studied constrained clustering
  problem. It captures constrained clustering as a generalized eigenvalue problem
  with graph Laplacians. The algorithm works in nearly-linear time and provides concrete
  guarantees for the quality of the clusters, at least for the case of 2-way partitioning.
  In practice this translates to a very fast implementation that consistently outperforms
  existing spectral approaches both in speed and quality.
