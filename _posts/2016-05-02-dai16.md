title: Provable Bayesian Inference via Particle Mirror Descent
abstract: Bayesian methods are appealing in their flexibility in modeling complex
  data and ability in capturing uncertainty in parameters. However, when Bayesâ€™ rule
  does not result in tractable closed-form, most approximate inference algorithms
  lack either scalability or rigorous guarantees. To tackle this challenge, we propose
  a simple yet provable algorithm, Particle Mirror Descent (PMD), to iteratively approximate
  the posterior density.  PMD is inspired by stochastic functional mirror descent
  where one descends in the density space using a small batch of data points at each
  iteration, and by particle filtering where one uses samples to approximate a function.
  We prove result of the first kind that, with m particles, PMD provides a posterior
  density estimator that converges in terms of KL-divergence to the true posterior
  in rate O(1/\sqrtm). We demonstrate competitive empirical performances of PMD compared
  to several approximate inference algorithms in mixture models, logistic regression,
  sparse Gaussian processes and latent Dirichlet allocation on large scale datasets.
