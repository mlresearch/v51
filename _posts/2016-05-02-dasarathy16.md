title: Active Learning Algorithms for Graphical Model Selection
abstract: The problem of learning the structure of a high dimensional graphical model
  from data has received considerable attention in recent years. In many applications
  such as sensor networks and proteomics  it is often expensive to obtain samples
  from all the variables involved simultaneously. For instance, this might involve
  the synchronization of a large number of sensors or the tagging of a large number
  of proteins.  To address this important issue, we initiate the study of a novel
  graphical model selection problem, where the goal is to optimize the total number
  of scalar samples obtained by allowing the collection of samples from only subsets
  of the variables. We propose a general paradigm for graphical model selection where
  feedback is used to guide the sampling to high degree vertices, while obtaining
  only few samples from the ones with the low degrees. We instantiate this framework
  with two specific active learning algorithms, one of which makes mild assumptions
  but is computationally expensive, while the other is computationally more efficient
  but requires stronger (nevertheless standard) assumptions. Whereas the sample complexity
  of passive algorithms is typically a function of the maximum degree of the graph,
  we show that the sample complexity of our algorithms is provably smaller and that
  it depends on a novel local complexity measure that is akin to the average degree
  of the graph. We finally demonstrate the efficacy of our framework via simulations.
