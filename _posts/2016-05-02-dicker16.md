title: Maximum Likelihood for Variance Estimation in High-Dimensional Linear Models
abstract: We study maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for the residual variance,  the
  signal-to-noise ratio, and other variance  parameters in high-dimensional linear
  models. These parameters are essential in many statistical applications involving
  regression diagnostics, inference,  tuning parameter selection for high-dimensional
  regression, and other applications, including genetics.   The estimators that we
  study are not new, and have been widely used for variance component estimation in
  linear random-effects models.  However, our analysis is new and it implies that
  the MLEs, which were devised for random-effects models, may also perform very well
  in high-dimensional linear models with fixed-effects, which are more commonly studied
  in some areas of high-dimensional statistics.  The MLEs are shown to be consistent
  and asymptotically normal in fixed-effects models with random design, in asymptotic
  settings where the number of predictors ($p$) is proportional to the number of observations
  ($n$).  Moreover, the estimatorsâ€™ asymptotic variance can be given explicitly in terms
  moments of the Marcenko-Pastur distribution.  A variety of analytical and empirical
  results show that the MLEs outperform other, previously proposed estimators for
  variance parameters in high-dimensional linear models with fixed-effects.  More
  broadly, the results in this paper illustrate a strategy for drawing connections
  between fixed- and random-effects models in high dimensions, which may be useful
  in other applications.
