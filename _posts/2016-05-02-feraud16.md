title: Random Forest for the Contextual Bandit Problem
abstract: To address the contextual bandit problem, we propose an online random forest
  algorithm. The analysis of the proposed algorithm is based on the sample complexity
  needed to find the optimal decision stump. Then, the decision stumps are recursively
  stacked in a random collection of decision trees, BANDIT FOREST. We show that the
  proposed algorithm is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The dependence of the sample
  complexity upon the number of contextual variables is logarithmic. The computational
  cost of the proposed algorithm with respect to the time horizon is linear. These
  analytical results allow the proposed algorithm to be efficient in real applications
  , where the number of events to process is huge, and where we expect that some contextual
  variables, chosen from a large set, have potentially non-linear dependencies with
  the rewards. In the experiments done to illustrate the theoretical analysis, BANDIT
  FOREST obtain promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms.
