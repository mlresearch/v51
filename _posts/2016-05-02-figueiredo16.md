title: 'Ordered Weighted L1 Regularized Regression with Strongly Correlated Covariates:
  Theoretical Aspects'
abstract: 'This paper studies the ordered weighted L1 (OWL) family of regularizers
  for sparse linear regression with strongly correlated covariates.  We prove sufficient
  conditions for clustering correlated covariates, extending and qualitatively strengthening
  previous results for a particular member of the OWL family: OSCAR (octagonal shrinkage
  and clustering algorithm for regression).  We derive error bounds for OWL with correlated
  Gaussian covariates: for cases in which clusters of covariates are strongly (even
  perfectly) correlated, but covariates in different clusters are uncorrelated, we
  show that if the true p-dimensional signal involves only s  clusters, then O(s \log
  p) samples suffice to accurately estimate it, regardless of the number of coefficients
  within the clusters.  Since the estimation of s-sparse signals with completely independent
  covariates also requires O(s \log p) measurements, this shows that by using OWL
  regularization, we pay no price (in the number of measurements) for the presence
  of strongly correlated covariates.'
