title: Loss Bounds and Time Complexity for Speed Priors
abstract: This paper establishes for the first time the predictive performance of
  speed priors and their computational complexity. A speed prior is essentially a
  probability distribution that puts low probability on strings that are not efficiently
  computable. We propose a variant to the original speed prior (Schmidhuber, 2002),
  and show that our prior can predict sequences drawn from probability measures that
  are estimable in polynomial time. Our speed prior is computable in doubly-exponential
  time, but not in polynomial time. On a polynomial time computable sequence our speed
  prior is computable in exponential time. We show that Schmidhuberâ€™s speed prior
  has better complexity under the same conditions; however, the question of its predictive
  properties remains open.
