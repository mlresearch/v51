title: Bayesian Generalised Ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo
abstract: 'Bayesian generalised ensemble (BayesGE) is a new method that addresses
  two major drawbacks of standard Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference
  in high-dimensional probability models: inapplicability to estimate the partition
  function and poor mixing properties. BayesGE uses a Bayesian approach to iteratively
  update the belief about the density of states (distribution of the log likelihood
  under the prior) for the model, with the dual purpose of enhancing the sampling
  efficiency and making the estimation of the partition function tractable. We benchmark
  BayesGE on Ising and Potts systems and show that it compares favourably to existing
  state-of-the-art methods.'
