title: Improved Learning Complexity in Combinatorial Pure Exploration Bandits
abstract: We study the problem of combinatorial pure exploration in the stochastic
  multi-armed bandit problem. We first construct a new measure of complexity that
  provably characterizes the learning performance of the algorithms we propose for
  the fixed confidence and the fixed budget setting. We show that this complexity
  is never higher than the one in existing work and illustrate a number of configurations
  in which it can be significantly smaller. While in general this improvement comes
  at the cost of increased computational complexity, we provide a series of examples,
  including a planning problem, where this extra cost is not significant.
