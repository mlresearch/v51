title: 'CRAFT: ClusteR-specific Assorted Feature selecTion'
abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering with cluster-specific
  feature selection. We derive a simplified model, CRAFT, by analyzing the asymptotic
  behavior of the log posterior formulations in a nonparametric MAP-based clustering
  setting in this framework. CRAFT handles assorted data, i.e., both numeric and categorical
  data, and the underlying objective functions are intuitively appealing. The resulting
  algorithm is simple to implement and scales nicely, requires minimal parameter tuning,
  obviates the need to specify the number of clusters a priori, and compares favorably
  with other state-of-the-art methods on real datasets. We also provide empirical
  evidence on carefully designed synthetic data sets to highlight the robustness of
  the algorithm to recover the underlying feature subspaces, even when the average
  dimensionality of the features across clusters is misspecified. Besides, the framework
  seamlessly allows for multiple views of clustering by interpolating between the
  two extremes of cluster-specific feature selection and global selection, and recovers
  the DP-means objective under the degenerate setting of clustering without feature
  selection.
