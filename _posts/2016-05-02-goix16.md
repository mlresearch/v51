title: Sparse Representation of Multivariate Extremes with Applications to Anomaly
  Ranking
abstract: Extremes play a special role in Anomaly Detection. Beyond inference and
  simulation purposes, probabilistic tools borrowed from Extreme Value Theory (EVT),
  such as the \textitangular measure, can also be used to design novel statistical
  learning methods for Anomaly Detection/ranking. This paper proposes a new algorithm
  based on multivariate EVT to learn how to rank observations in a high dimensional
  space with respect to their degree of ‘abnormality’. The procedure relies on an
  original dimension-reduction technique in the extreme domain that possibly produces
  a sparse representation of multivariate extremes and allows to gain insight into
  the dependence structure thereof, escaping the curse of dimensionality. The representation
  output by the unsupervised methodology we propose here can be combined with any
  Anomaly Detection technique tailored to non-extreme data. As it performs linearly
  with the dimension and almost linearly in the data (in O(d n \log n)), it fits to
  large scale problems. The approach in this paper is novel in that EVT has never
  been used in its multivariate version in the field of Anomaly Detection. Illustrative
  experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach.
