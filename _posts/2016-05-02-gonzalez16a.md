title: Batch Bayesian Optimization via Local Penalization
abstract: The popularity of Bayesian optimization methods for efficient exploration
  of parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as
  surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches only
  allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is
  desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This
  is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available.
  These could either be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized.
  Batch methods, however, require the modeling of the interaction between the different
  evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate
  this issue and propose a highly effective heuristic based on an estimate of the
  function’s Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction–local
  repulsion–at negligible computational overhead. A penalized acquisition function
  is used to collect batches of points minimizing the non-parallelizable computational
  effort. The resulting algorithm compares very well, in run-time, with much more
  elaborate alternatives.
