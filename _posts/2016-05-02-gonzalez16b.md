title: 'GLASSES: Relieving The Myopia Of Bayesian Optimisation'
abstract: 'We present GLASSES: Global optimisation with Look-Ahead through Stochastic
  Simulation and Expected-loss Search. The majority of global optimisation approaches
  in use are myopic, in only considering the impact of the next function value; the
  non-myopic approaches that do exist are able to consider only a handful of future
  evaluations. Our novel algorithm, GLASSES, permits the consideration of dozens of
  evaluations into the future. This is done by approximating the ideal look-ahead
  loss function, which is expensive to evaluate, by a cheaper alternative in which
  the future steps of the algorithm are simulated beforehand. An Expectation Propagation
  algorithm is used to compute the expected value of the loss. We show that the far-horizon
  planning thus enabled leads to substantive performance gains in empirical tests.'
