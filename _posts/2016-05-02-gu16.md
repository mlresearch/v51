title: Low-Rank and Sparse Structure Pursuit via Alternating Minimization
abstract: In this paper, we present a nonconvex alternating minimization optimization
  algorithm for low-rank and sparse structure pursuit. Compared with convex relaxation
  based methods, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efficient for large
  scale problems.    In our study, we define a notion of bounded difference of gradients,
  based on which we rigorously prove that with suitable initialization, the proposed
  nonconvex optimization algorithm enjoys linear convergence to the global optima
  and exactly recovers the underlying low rank and sparse matrices under standard
  conditions such as incoherence and sparsity conditions. For a wide range of statistical   models
  such as multi-task learning and robust principal component analysis (RPCA), our
  algorithm provides a principled approach to learning the low rank and sparse structures
  with provable guarantee. Thorough experiments on both synthetic and real datasets
  backup our theory.
