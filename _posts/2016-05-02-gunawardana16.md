title: Universal Models of Multivariate Temporal Point Processes
abstract: With the rapidly increasing availability of event stream data there is growing
  interest in multivariate temporal point process models to capture both qualitative
  and quantitative features of this type of data. Recent research on multivariate
  point processes have focused in inference and estimation problems for restricted
  classes of models such as continuous time Bayesian networks, Markov jump processes,
  Gaussian Cox processes, and Hawkes Processes.   In this paper, we study the expressive
  power and learnability of Graphical Event Models (GEMs) â€“ the analogue of directed
  graphical models for multivariate temporal point processes. In particular, we describe
  a set of Graphical Event Models (GEMs) and show that this class can universally
  approximate any smooth multivariate temporal point process. We also describe a universal
  learning algorithm for this class of GEMs and show, under a mild set of assumptions,
  learnability results for both the dependency structures and distributions in this
  class. Our consistency results demonstrate the possibility of learning about both
  qualitative and quantitative dependencies from rich event stream data.
