title: A PAC RL Algorithm for Episodic POMDPs
abstract: Many interesting real world domains involve reinforcement learning (RL)
  in partially observable environments. Efficient learning in such domains is important,
  but existing sample complexity bounds for partially observable RL are at least exponential
  in the episode length. We give, to our knowledge, the first partially observable
  RL algorithm with a polynomial bound on the number of episodes on which the algorithm
  may not achieve near-optimal performance. Our algorithm is suitable for an important
  class of episodic POMDPs. Our approach builds on recent advances in the method of
  moments for latent variable model estimation.
