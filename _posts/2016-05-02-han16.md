title: Variational Gaussian Copula Inference
abstract: We utilize copulas to constitute a unified framework for constructing and
  optimizing variational proposals in hierarchical Bayesian models. For models with
  continuous and non-Gaussian hidden variables, we propose a semiparametric and automated
  variational  Gaussian copula approach, in which the parametric Gaussian copula family
  is able to preserve multivariate posterior dependence, and the nonparametric transformations
  based on Bernstein polynomials provide ample flexibility in characterizing the univariate
  marginal posteriors.
