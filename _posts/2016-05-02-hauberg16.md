title: 'Dreaming More Data: Class-dependent Distributions over Diffeomorphisms for
  Learned Data Augmentation'
abstract: Data augmentation is a key element in training high-dimensional models.   In
  this approach, one synthesizes new observations by applying pre-specified transformations   to
  the original training data; e.g. new images are formed by rotating old ones.   Current
  augmentation schemes, however, rely on manual specification of the applied transformations,    making
  data augmentation   an implicit form of feature engineering. With an eye towards
  true end-to-end   learning, we suggest learning the applied transformations on a
  per-class basis.   Particularly, we align image pairs within each class under the
  assumption that the   spatial transformation between images belongs to a large class
  of diffeomorphisms.   We then learn a class-specific probabilistic generative models
  of the transformations in a Riemannian   submanifold of the Lie group of diffeomorphisms.
  We demonstrate significant   performance improvements in training deep neural nets
  over manually-specified   augmentation schemes.    Our code and augmented datasets
  are available online.
