title: Non-Stationary Gaussian Process Regression with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
abstract: We present a novel approach for non-stationary Gaussian process regression
  (GPR), where the three key parameters – noise variance, signal variance and lengthscale
  – can be simultaneously input-dependent. We develop gradient-based inference methods
  to learn the unknown function and the non-stationary model parameters, without requiring
  any model approximations. For inferring the full posterior distribution we use Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo (HMC), which conveniently extends the analytical gradient-based GPR
  learning by guiding the sampling with the gradients. The MAP solution can also be
  learned with gradient ascent. In experiments on several synthetic datasets and in
  modelling of temporal gene expression, the non-stationary GPR is shown to give major
  improvement when modeling realistic input-dependent dynamics.
