title: 'DUAL-LOCO: Distributing Statistical Estimation Using Random Projections'
abstract: We present DUAL-LOCO, a communication-efficient algorithm for distributed
  statistical estimation. DUAL-LOCO assumes that the data is distributed across workers
  according to the features rather than the samples. It requires only a single round
  of communication where low-dimensional random projections are used to approximate
  the dependencies between features available to different workers. We show that DUAL-LOCO
  has bounded approximation error which only depends weakly on the number of workers.
  We compare DUAL-LOCO against a state-of-the-art distributed optimization method
  on a variety of real world datasets and show that it obtains better speedups while
  retaining good accuracy. In particular, DUAL-LOCO allows for fast cross validation
  as only part of the algorithm depends on the regularization parameter.
