title: Scalable Gaussian Processes for Characterizing Multidimensional Change Surfaces
abstract: We present a scalable Gaussian process model for identifying and characterizing
  smooth multidimensional changepoints, and automatically learning changes in expressive
  covariance structure. We use Random Kitchen Sink features to flexibly define a change
  surface in combination with expressive spectral mixture kernels to capture the complex
  statistical structure.  Finally, through the use of novel methods for additive non-separable
  kernels, we can scale the model to large datasets. We demonstrate the model on numerical
  and real world data, including a large spatio-temporal disease dataset where we
  identify previously unknown heterogeneous changes in space and time.
