title: Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Simultaneous Estimation of Rewards and
  Dynamics
abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) describes the problem of learning an
  unknown reward function of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from observed behavior
  of an agent. Since the agent’s behavior originates in its policy and MDP policies
  depend on both the stochastic system dynamics as well as the reward function, the
  solution of the inverse problem is significantly influenced by both. Current IRL
  approaches assume that if the transition model is unknown, additional samples from
  the system’s dynamics are accessible, or the observed behavior provides enough samples
  of the system’s dynamics to solve the inverse problem accurately. These assumptions
  are often not satisfied. To overcome this, we present a gradient-based IRL approach
  that simultaneously estimates the system’s dynamics. By solving the combined optimization
  problem, our approach takes into account the bias of the demonstrations, which stems
  from the generating policy. The evaluation on a synthetic MDP and a transfer learning
  task shows improvements regarding the sample efficiency as well as the accuracy
  of the estimated reward functions and transition models.
