title: 'Bayes-Optimal Effort Allocation in Crowdsourcing: Bounds and Index Policies'
abstract: We consider effort allocation in crowdsourcing, where we wish to assign
  labeling tasks to imperfect homogeneous crowd workers to maximize overall accuracy
  in a continuous-time Bayesian setting, subject to budget and time constraints. The
  Bayes-optimal policy for this problem is the solution to a partially observable
  Markov decision process, but the curse of dimensionality renders the computation
  infeasible. Following a similar approach to the Lagrangian Relaxation technique
  in Adelman and Mersereau (2008), we provide a computationally tractable instance-specific
  upper bound on the value of this Bayes-optimal policy, which can in turn be used
  to bound the optimality gap of any other sub-optimal policy. In an approach similar
  in spirit to the Whittle index for restless multi-armed bandits, we provide an index
  policy for effort allocation in crowdsourcing and demonstrate numerically that it
  outperforms other state-of-the-art policies and performs close to optimal.
