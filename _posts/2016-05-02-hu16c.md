title: Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Discrete Data with Hierarchical Side-Information
abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for efficient non-negative matrix factorization
  of discrete (count/binary) data with side-information. The side-information is given
  as a multi-level structure, taxonomy, or ontology, with nodes at each level being
  categorical-valued observations. For example, when modeling documents with a two-level
  side-information (documents being at level-zero), level-one may represent (one or
  more) authors associated with each document and level-two may represent affiliations
  of each author. The model easily generalizes to more than two levels (or taxonomy/ontology
  of arbitrary depth). Our model can learn embeddings of entities present at each
  level in the data/side-information hierarchy (e.g., documents, authors, affiliations,
  in the previous example), with appropriate sharing of information across levels.
  The model also enjoys full local conjugacy, facilitating efficient Gibbs sampling
  for model inference. Inference cost scales in the number of non-zero entries in
  the data matrix, which is especially appealing for real-world massive but sparse
  matrices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model on several real-world data
  sets.
