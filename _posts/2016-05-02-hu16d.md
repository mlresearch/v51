title: Topic-Based Embeddings for Learning from Large Knowledge Graphs
abstract: We present a scalable probabilistic framework for learning from multi-relational
  data given in form of entity-relation-entity triplets, with a potentially massive
  number of entities and relations (e.g., in multi-relational networks, knowledge
  bases, etc.). We define each triplet via a relation-specific bilinear function of
  the embeddings  of entities associated with it (these embeddings correspond to “topics”).
  To handle massive number of relations and the data sparsity problem (very few observations
  per relation), we also extend this model to allow sharing of parameters across relations,
  which leads to a substantial reduction in the number of parameters to be learned.
  In addition to yielding excellent predictive performance (e.g., for knowledge base
  completion tasks), the interpretability of our topic-based embedding framework enables
  easy qualitative analyses. Computational cost of our models scales in the number
  of positive triplets, which makes it easy to scale to massive real-world multi-relational
  data sets, which are usually extremely sparse. We develop simple-to-implement batch
  as well as online Gibbs sampling algorithms and demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our models on tasks such as multi-relational link-prediction, and learning from
  large knowledge bases.
