title: Unsupervised Ensemble Learning with Dependent Classifiers
abstract: 'In unsupervised ensemble learning, one obtains predictions from multiple
  sources or classifiers, yet without knowing the reliability and expertise of each
  source, and with no labeled data to assess it. The task is to combine these possibly
  conï¬‚icting predictions into an accurate meta-learner. Most works to date assumed
  perfect diversity between the different sources, a property known as conditional
  independence. In realistic scenarios, however, this assumption is often violated,
  and ensemble learners based on it can be severely sub-optimal. The key challenges
  we address in this paper are: (i) how to detect, in an unsupervised manner, strong
  violations of conditional independence; and (ii) construct a suitable meta-learner.
  To this end we introduce a statistical model that allows for dependencies between
  classifiers. Based on this model, we develop novel unsupervised methods to detect
  strongly dependent classifiers, better estimate their accuracies, and construct
  an improved meta-learner. Using both artificial and real datasets, we showcase the
  importance of taking classifier dependencies into account and the competitive performance
  of our approach.'
