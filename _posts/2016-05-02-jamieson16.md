title: Non-stochastic Best Arm Identification and Hyperparameter Optimization
abstract: Motivated by the task of hyperparameter optimization, we introduce the \em
  non-stochastic best-arm identification problem. We identify an attractive algorithm  for
  this setting that makes no assumptions on the convergence behavior of the armsâ€™
  losses, has no free-parameters to adjust, provably outperforms the uniform allocation
  baseline in favorable conditions, and performs comparably (up to \log factors) otherwise.
  Next, by leveraging the iterative nature of many  learning algorithms, we cast hyperparameter
  optimization as an instance of non-stochastic best-arm identification. Our empirical
  results show that, by allocating more resources to promising hyperparameter settings,
  our approach achieves comparable test accuracies an order of magnitude faster than
  the uniform strategy. The robustness and simplicity of our approach makes it well-suited
  to ultimately replace the uniform strategy currently used in most machine learning
  software packages.
