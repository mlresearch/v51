title: Top Arm Identification in  Multi-Armed Bandits with Batch Arm Pulls
abstract: 'We introduce a new multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in which arms must
  be sampled in batches, rather than one at a time. This is motivated by applications
  in social media monitoring and biological experimentation where such batch constraints
  naturally arise. This paper develops and analyzes algorithms for batch MABs and
  top arm identification, for both fixed confidence and fixed budget settings. Our
  main theoretical results show that the batch constraint does not significantly affect
  the sample complexity of top arm identification compared to unconstrained MAB algorithms.
  Alternatively, if one views a batch as the fundamental sampling unit, then the results
  can be interpreted as showing that the sample complexity of batch MABs can be significantly
  less than traditional MABs. We demonstrate the new batch MAB algorithms with simulations
  and in two interesting real-world applications: (i) microwell array experiments
  for identifying genes that are important in virus replication and (ii) finding the
  most active users in Twitter on a specific topic.'
