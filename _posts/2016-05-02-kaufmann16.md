title: Bayesian Markov Blanket Estimation
abstract: This paper considers a Bayesian view for estimating the Markov blanket of
  a set of query variables, where the set of potential neighbours here is big.  We
  factorize the posterior such that the Markov blanket is conditionally independent
  of the network of the potential neighbours. By exploiting this blockwise decoupling,
  we derive analytic expressions for posterior conditionals. Subsequently, we develop
  an inference scheme, which makes use of the factorization. As a result, estimation
  of a sub-network is possible without inferring an entire network.  Since the resulting
  Gibbs sampler scales linearly with the number of variables, it can handle relatively
  large neighbourhoods. The proposed scheme results in faster convergence and superior
  mixing of the Markov chain than existing Bayesian network estimation techniques.
