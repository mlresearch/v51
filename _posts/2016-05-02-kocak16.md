title: Online Learning with Noisy Side Observations
abstract: We propose a new partial-observability model for online learning problems
  where the learner, besides its own loss, also observes some noisy feedback about
  the other actions, depending on the underlying structure of the problem. We represent
  this structure by a weighted directed graph, where the edge weights are related
  to the quality of the feedback shared by the connected nodes. Our main contribution
  is an efficient algorithm that guarantees a regret of O(\sqrt(α^* T) after T rounds,
  where α^* is a novel  graph  property that we call the effective independence number.
  Our algorithm is completely parameter-free and does not require knowledge (or even
  estimation) of alpha^*. For the special case of binary edge weights, our setting
  reduces to the partial-observability models of Mannor & Shamir (2011) and Alon et
  al. (2013) and our algorithm recovers the near-optimal regret bounds.
