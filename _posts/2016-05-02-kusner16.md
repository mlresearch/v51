title: Private Causal Inference
abstract: Causal inference deals with identifying which random variables ”cause” or
  control other random variables. Recent advances on the topic of causal inference
  based on tools from statistical estimation and machine learning have resulted in
  practical algorithms for causal inference. Causal inference has the potential to
  have significant impact on medical research, prevention and control of diseases,
  and identifying factors that impact economic changes to name just a few. However,
  these promising applications for causal inference are often ones that involve sensitive
  or personal data of users that need to be kept private (e.g., medical records, personal
  finances, etc). Therefore, there is a need for the development of causal inference
  methods that preserve data privacy. We study the problem of inferring causality
  using the current, popular causal inference framework, the additive noise model
  (ANM) while simultaneously ensuring privacy of the users. Our framework provides
  differential privacy guarantees for a variety of ANM variants. We run extensive
  experiments, and demonstrate that our techniques are practical and easy to implement.
