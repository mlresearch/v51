title: Convex Block-sparse Linear Regression with Expanders – Provably
abstract: Sparse matrices are favorable objects in machine learning and optimization.
  When such matrices are used, in place of dense ones, the overall complexity requirements
  in optimization can be significantly reduced in practice, both in terms of space
  and run-time.  Prompted by this observation, we study a convex optimization scheme
  for block-sparse recovery from linear measurements.  To obtain linear sketches,
  we use expander matrices, i.e., sparse matrices containing only few non-zeros per
  column. Hitherto, to the best of our knowledge, such algorithmic solutions have
  been only studied from a non-convex perspective. Our aim here is to theoretically
  characterize the performance of convex approaches under such setting.   Our key
  novelty is the expression of the recovery error in terms of the model-based norm,
  while assuring that solution lives in the model.  To achieve this, we show that
  sparse model-based matrices satisfy a group version of the null-space property.  Our
  experimental findings on synthetic and real applications support our claims for
  faster recovery in the convex setting – as opposed to using dense sensing matrices,
  while showing a competitive recovery performance.
