title: Mondrian Forests for Large-Scale Regression when Uncertainty Matters
abstract: Many real-world regression problems demand a measure of the uncertainty
  associated with each prediction.  Standard decision forests deliver efficient state-of-the-art
  predictive performance, but high-quality uncertainty estimates are lacking. Gaussian
  processes (GPs) deliver uncertainty estimates, but scaling GPs to large-scale data
  sets comes at the cost of approximating the uncertainty estimates.  We extend Mondrian
  forests, first proposed by Lakshminarayanan et al. (2014) for classification problems,
  to the large-scale nonparametric regression setting. Using a novel hierarchical
  Gaussian prior that dovetails with the Mondrian forest framework, we obtain principled
  uncertainty estimates,  while still retaining the computational advantages of decision
  forests. Through a combination of illustrative examples, real-world large-scale
  datasets and Bayesian optimization benchmarks, we demonstrate that Mondrian forests
  outperform approximate GPs on large-scale regression tasks and deliver better-calibrated
  uncertainty assessments than decision-forest-based methods.
