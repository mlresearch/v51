title: 'Cut Pursuit: Fast Algorithms to Learn Piecewise Constant Functions'
abstract: We propose working-set/greedy algorithms to efficiently solve problems penalized
  respectively by the total variation and the Mumford Shah boundary size when the
  piecewise constant solutions has a small number of levelsets. Our algorithms exploit
  this structure by recursively splitting the level-sets using graph cuts. We obtain
  significant speed up on images that can be approximated with few levelsets compared
  to state-of-the-art algorithms.
