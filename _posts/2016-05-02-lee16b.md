title: Fast Saddle-Point Algorithm for Generalized Dantzig Selector and FDR Control
  with Ordered L1-Norm
abstract: In this paper we propose a primal-dual proximal extragradient algorithm
  to solve the generalized Dantzig selector (GDS) estimation problem, based on a new
  convex-concave saddle-point (SP) reformulation. Our new formulation makes it possible
  to adopt recent developments in saddle-point optimization, to achieve the optimal
  O(1/k) rate of convergence. Compared to the optimal non-SP algorithms, ours do not
  require specification of sensitive parameters that affect algorithm performance
  or solution quality. We also provide a new analysis showing a possibility of local
  acceleration to achieve the rate of O(1/k^2) in special cases even without strong
  convexity or strong smoothness. As an application, we propose a GDS equipped with
  the ordered \ell_1-norm, showing its false discovery rate control properties in
  variable selection.  Algorithm performance is compared between ours and other alternatives,
  including the linearized ADMM, Nesterov’s smoothing, Nemirovski’s mirror-prox, and
  the accelerated hybrid proximal extragradient techniques.
