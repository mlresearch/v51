title: A Lasso-based Sparse Knowledge Gradient Policy for Sequential Optimal Learning
abstract: We propose a sequential learning policy for noisy discrete global optimization
  and ranking and selection (R&S) problems with high dimensional sparse belief functions,
  where there are hundreds or even thousands of features, but only a small portion
  of these features contain explanatory power. Our problem setting, motivated by the
  experimental sciences, arises where we have to choose which experiment to run next.
  Here the experiments are time-consuming and expensive. We derive a sparse knowledge
  gradient (SpKG) decision policy based on the \ell_1-penalized regression Lasso to
  identify the sparsity pattern before our budget is exhausted. This policy is a unique
  and novel hybrid of Bayesian R&S with a frequentist learning approach. Theoretically,
  we provide the error bound of the posterior mean estimate, which has shown to be
  at the minimax optimal \sqrts\log p/n rate. Controlled experiments on both synthetic
  data and real application for automatically designing experiments to identify the
  structure of an RNA molecule show that the algorithm efficiently learns the correct
  set of nonzero parameters. It also outperforms several other learning policies.
