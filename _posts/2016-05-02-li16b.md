title: Rivalry of Two Families of Algorithms for Memory-Restricted Streaming PCA
abstract: We study the problem of recovering the subspace spanned by the first k principal
  components of d-dimensional data under the streaming setting, with a memory bound
  of O(kd). Two families of algorithms are known for this problem. The first family
  is based on the framework of stochastic gradient descent. Nevertheless, the convergence
  rate of the family can be seriously affected by the learning rate of the descent
  steps and deserves more serious study. The second family is based on the power method
  over blocks of data, but setting the block size for its existing algorithms is not
  an easy task. In this paper, we analyze the convergence rate of a representative
  algorithm with decayed learning rate (Oja and Karhunen, 1985) in the first family
  for the general k>1 case. Moreover, we propose a novel algorithm for the second
  family that sets the block sizes automatically and dynamically with faster convergence
  rate. We then conduct empirical studies that fairly compare the two families on
  real-world data. The studies reveal the advantages and disadvantages of these two
  families.
