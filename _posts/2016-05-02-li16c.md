title: An Improved Convergence Analysis of Cyclic Block Coordinate Descent-type Methods
  for Strongly Convex Minimization
abstract: The cyclic block coordinate descent-type (CBCD-type) methods have shown
  remarkable computational performance for solving strongly convex minimization problems.
  Typical applications include many popular statistical machine learning methods such
  as elastic-net regression, ridge penalized logistic regression, and sparse additive
  regression. Existing optimization literature has shown that the CBCD-type methods
  attain iteration complexity of O(p⋅\log(1/ε)),  where εis a pre-specified accuracy
  of the objective value, and p is the number of blocks. However, such iteration complexity
  explicitly depends on p, and therefore is at least p times worse than those of gradient
  descent methods. To bridge this theoretical gap, we propose an improved convergence
  analysis for the CBCD-type methods. In particular, we first show that for a family
  of quadratic minimization problems, the iteration complexity of the CBCD-type methods
  matches that of the GD methods in term of dependency on p (up to a \log^2 p factor).
  Thus our complexity bounds are sharper than the existing bounds by at least a factor
  of p/\log^2p. We also provide a lower bound to confirm that our improved complexity
  bounds are tight (up to a \log^2 p factor) if the largest and smallest eigenvalues
  of the Hessian matrix do not scale with p. Finally, we generalize our analysis to
  other strongly convex minimization problems beyond quadratic ones.
