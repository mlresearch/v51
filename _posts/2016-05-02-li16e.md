title: High Dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Restricted Projection Pursuit Models
abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is commonly used to optimize blackbox objective
  functions which are expensive to evaluate. A common approach is based on using Gaussian
  Process (GP) to model the objective function. Applying GP to higher dimensional
  settings is generally difficult due to the curse of dimensionality for nonparametric
  regression. Existing works makes strong assumptions such as the function is low-dimensional
  embedding (Wang et al., 2013) or is axis-aligned additive (Kandasamy et al., 2015).
  In this pa- per, we generalize the existing assumption to a projected-additive assumption.
  Our generalization provides the benefits of i) greatly increasing the space of functions
  that can be modeled by our approach, which covers the previous works (Wang et al.,
  2013; Kandasamy et al., 2015) as special cases, and ii) efficiently handling the
  learning in a larger model space. We prove that the regret for projected-additive
  functions has only linear dependence on the number of dimensions in this general
  setting. Directly using projected-additive GP (Gilboa et al., 2013) to BO results
  in a non-box constraint, which is not easy to optimize. We tackle this problem by
  proposing a restricted-projection-pursuit GP for BO. We conduct experiments on synthetic
  examples and scientific and hyper-parameter tuning tasks in many cases. Our method
  outperforms existing approaches even when the function does not meet the projected
  additive assumption. Last, we study the validity of the additive and projected-additive
  assumption in practice.
