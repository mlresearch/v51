title: Efficient Sampling for k-Determinantal Point Processes
abstract: 'Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are elegant probabilistic models of
  repulsion and diversity over discrete sets of items. But their applicability to
  large sets is hindered by expensive cubic-complexity matrix operations for basic
  tasks such as sampling. In light of this, we propose a new method for approximate
  sampling from discrete k-DPPs. Our method takes advantage of the diversity property
  of subsets sampled from a DPP, and proceeds in two stages: first it constructs coresets
  for the ground set of items; thereafter, it efficiently samples subsets based on
  the constructed coresets. As opposed to previous approaches, our algorithm aims
  to minimize the total variation distance to the original distribution. Experiments
  on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that our sampling algorithm works efficiently
  on large data sets, and yields more accurate samples than previous approaches.'
