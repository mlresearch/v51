title: One Scan 1-Bit Compressed Sensing
abstract: Based on α-stable random projections with small α, we develop a simple algorithm
  for compressed sensing (sparse signal recovery) by utilizing only the signs (i.e.,
  1-bit) of the measurements.  Using only 1-bit information of the measurements  results
  in substantial cost reduction  in collection, storage, communication, and decoding
  for compressed sensing.  The proposed algorithm is efficient in that the decoding
  procedure requires only one scan of the coordinates. Our analysis can precisely
  show that, for a K-sparse signal of length N, 12.3K\log N/δmeasurements (where δis
  the confidence) would be sufficient for recovering the support and the signs of
  the signal. While the method is highly robust against typical measurement noises,
  we also provide the analysis of the scheme under   random flipping of the signs
  of  measurements.    Compared to the well-known work on 1-bit marginal regression
  (which can also be viewed as a one-scan method), the proposed algorithm requires
  orders of magnitude fewer measurements. Compared to  1-bit Iterative Hard Thresholding
  (IHT) (which is not a one-scan algorithm), our method is still significantly more
  accurate. Furthermore, the proposed method is reasonably robust against random sign
  flipping while IHT is known to be very sensitive to this type of noise.
