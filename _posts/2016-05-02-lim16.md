title: Efficient Bregman Projections onto the Permutahedron and Related Polytopes
abstract: The problem of projecting onto the permutahedron \mathbfPH(c) – the convex
  hull of all permutations of a fixed vector c – under a uniformly separable Bregman
  divergence is shown to be reducible to the Isotonic Optimization problem. This allows
  us to employ known fast algorithms to improve on several recent results on Bregman
  projections onto permutahedra. In addition, we present a new algorithm \rm mergepool
  that have better complexity when the number of distinct entries d in the vector
  c is small, the simplex being one such example, with c=(1,0,0,\dotsc,0)^T and d=2.
  \rm mergepool runs in O(n \log d) for certain popular Bregman divergence measures
  and requires O((n \log d) \log \fracU ε) to find ε-close solutions for general uniformly
  separable Bregman divergences, where U is a bound on the width of the interval containing
  the dual solution components. These estimates matches or improves best known bounds
  for all Bregman projection problems onto various permutahedra, including recent
  results for projection onto the simplex. The same complexity bounds apply to signed
  permutahedra, a class that includes the \ell_1-ball as a special case. In summary,
  this work describes a fast unified approach to this well-known class of problems.
