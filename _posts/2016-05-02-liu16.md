title: Semi-Supervised Learning with Adaptive Spectral Transform
abstract: This paper proposes a novel nonparametric framework for semi-supervised
  learning and for optimizing the Laplacian spectrum of the data manifold simultaneously.
  Our formulation leads to a convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved
  via the bundle method, and can be interpreted as to asymptotically minimize the
  generalization error bound of semi-supervised learning with respect to the graph
  spectrum. Experiments over benchmark datasets in various domains show advantageous
  performance of the proposed method over strong baselines.
