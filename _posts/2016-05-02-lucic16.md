title: Strong Coresets for Hard and Soft Bregman Clustering with Applications to Exponential
  Family Mixtures
abstract: Coresets are efficient representations of data sets such that models trained
  on the coreset are provably competitive with models trained on the original data
  set. As such, they have been successfully used to scale up clustering models such
  as K-Means and Gaussian mixture models to massive data sets. However, until now,
  the algorithms and the corresponding theory were usually specific to each clustering
  problem.  We propose a single, practical algorithm to construct strong coresets
  for a large class of hard and soft clustering problems based on Bregman divergences.
  This class includes hard clustering with popular distortion measures such as the
  Squared Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance, KL-divergence and Itakura-Saito
  distance. The corresponding soft clustering problems are directly related to popular
  mixture models due to a dual relationship between Bregman divergences and Exponential
  family distributions. Our theoretical results further imply a randomized polynomial-time
  approximation scheme for hard clustering. We demonstrate the practicality of the
  proposed algorithm in an empirical evaluation.
