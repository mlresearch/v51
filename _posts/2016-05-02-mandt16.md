title: Variational Tempering
abstract: Variational inference (VI) combined with data subsampling enables approximate
  posterior inference with large data sets for otherwise intractable models, but suffers
  from poor local optima. We first formulate a deterministic annealing approach for
  the generic class of conditionally conjugate exponential family models. This algorithm
  uses a temperature parameter that deterministically deforms the objective and reduces
  this parameter over the course of the optimization. A well-known drawback in annealing
  is the choice of the annealing schedule. We therefore introduce variational tempering,
  a variational algorithm that introduces a temperature latent variable to the model.
  In contrast to related work in the Markov chain Monte Carlo literature, this algorithm
  results in adaptive annealing schedules. Lastly, we develop local variational tempering,
  which assigns a latent temperature to each data point; this allows for dynamic annealing
  that varies across data. Compared to the traditional VI, all proposed approaches
  find improved predictive likelihoods on held-out data.
