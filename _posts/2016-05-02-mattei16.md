title: Globally Sparse Probabilistic PCA
abstract: With the flourishing development of high-dimensional data, sparse versions
  of principal component analysis (PCA) have imposed themselves as simple, yet powerful
  ways of selecting relevant features in an unsupervised manner. However, when several
  sparse principal components are computed, the interpretation of the selected variables
  may be difficult since each axis has its own sparsity pattern and has to be interpreted
  separately. To overcome this drawback, we propose a Bayesian procedure that allows
  to obtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern. To this end,
  using Roweis’ probabilistic interpretation of PCA and an isotropic Gaussian prior
  on the loading matrix, we provide the first exact computation of the marginal likelihood
  of a Bayesian PCA model. In order to avoid the drawbacks of discrete model selection,
  we propose a simple relaxation of our framework which allows to find a path of models
  using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. The exact marginal likelihood
  can eventually be maximized over this path, relying on Occam’s razor to select the
  relevant variables. Since the sparsity pattern is common to all components, we call
  this approach globally sparse probabilistic PCA (GSPPCA). Its usefulness is illustrated
  on synthetic data sets and on several real unsupervised feature selection problems.
