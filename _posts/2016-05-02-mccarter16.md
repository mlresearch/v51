title: Large-Scale Optimization Algorithms for Sparse Conditional Gaussian Graphical
  Models
abstract: This paper addresses the problem of scalable optimization for L1-regularized
  conditional Gaussian graphical models.  Conditional Gaussian graphical models generalize
  the well-known Gaussian graphical models to conditional distributions to model the
  output network influenced by conditioning input variables. While highly scalable
  optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation, state-of-the-art
  methods for conditional Gaussian graphical models are not efficient enough and more
  importantly, fail due to memory constraints for very large problems. In this paper,
  we propose a new optimization procedure based on a Newton method that efficiently
  iterates over two sub-problems, leading to drastic improvement in computation time
  compared to the previous methods. We then extend our method to scale to large problems
  under memory constraints, using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage while
  achieving fast convergence. Using synthetic and genomic data, we show that our methods
  can solve problems with millions of variables and tens of billions of parameters
  to high accuracy on a single machine.
