title: Fitting Spectral Decay with the $k$-Support Norm
abstract: The spectral k-support norm enjoys good estimation properties in low rank
  matrix learning problems, empirically outperforming the trace norm.   Its unit ball
  is the convex hull of rank k matrices with unit Frobenius norm. In this paper we
  generalize the norm to the spectral (k,p)-support norm, whose additional parameter
  p can be used to tailor the norm to the decay of the spectrum of the underlying
  model. We characterize the unit ball and we explicitly compute the norm. We further
  provide a conditional gradient method to solve regularization problems with the
  norm, and we derive an efficient algorithm to compute the Euclidean projection on
  the unit ball in the case p=âˆž.  In numerical experiments, we show that allowing
  p to vary significantly improves performance over the spectral k-support norm on
  various matrix completion benchmarks, and better captures the spectral decay of
  the underlying model.
