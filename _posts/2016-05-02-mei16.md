title: On the Reducibility of Submodular Functions
abstract: The scalability of submodular optimization methods is critical for their
  usability in practice. In this paper, we study the reducibility of submodular functions,
  a property that enables us to reduce the solution space of submodular optimization
  problems without performance loss. We introduce the concept of reducibility using
  marginal gains. Then we show that by adding perturbation, we can endow irreducible
  functions with reducibility, based on which we propose the perturbation-reduction
  optimization framework. Our theoretical analysis proves that given the perturbation
  scales, the reducibility gain could be computed, and the performance loss has additive
  upper bounds. We further conduct empirical studies and the results demonstrate that
  our proposed framework significantly accelerates existing optimization methods for
  irreducible submodular functions with a cost of only small performance losses.
