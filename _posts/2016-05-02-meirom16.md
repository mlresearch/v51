title: 'NuC-MKL: A Convex Approach to Non Linear Multiple Kernel Learning'
abstract: Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) methods are known for their effectiveness
  in solving classification and regression problems involving multi-modal data. Many
  MKL approaches use linear combination of base kernels, resulting in somewhat limited
  feature representations. Several non-linear MKL formulations were proposed recently.
  They provide much higher dimensional feature spaces, and, therefore, richer representations.
  However, these methods often lead to non-convex optimization and to intractable
  number of optimization parameters.  In this paper, we propose a new non-linear MKL
  method that utilizes nuclear norm regularization and leads to convex optimization
  problem. The proposed Nuclear-norm-Constrained MKL (NuC-MKL) algorithm converges
  faster, and requires smaller number of calls to an SVM solver, as compared to other
  competing methods. Moreover, the number of the model support vectors in our approach
  is usually much smaller, as compared to other methods. This suggests that our algorithm
  is more resilient to overfitting. We test our algorithm on several known benchmarks,
  and show that it equals or outperforms the state-of-the-art MKL methods on all these
  data sets.
