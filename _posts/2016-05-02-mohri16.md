title: Accelerating Online Convex Optimization via Adaptive Prediction
abstract: We present a powerful general framework for designing data-dependent online
  convex optimization algorithms, building upon and unifying recent techniques in
  adaptive regularization, optimistic gradient predictions, and problem-dependent
  randomization. We first present a series of new regret guarantees that hold at any
  time and under very minimal assumptions, and then show how different relaxations
  recover existing algorithms, both basic as well as more recent sophisticated   ones.
  Finally, we show how combining adaptivity, optimism, and problem-dependent randomization
  can guide the design of algorithms that benefit from more favorable guarantees than
  recent state-of-the-art methods.
