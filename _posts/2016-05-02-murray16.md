title: Pseudo-Marginal Slice Sampling
abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods asymptotically sample from complex
  probability distributions. The pseudo-marginal MCMC framework only requires an unbiased
  estimator of the unnormalized probability distribution function to construct a Markov
  chain. However, the resulting chains are harder to tune to a target distribution
  than conventional MCMC, and the types of updates available are limited. We describe
  a general way to clamp and update the random numbers used in a pseudo-marginal methodâ€™s
  unbiased estimator. In this framework we can use slice sampling and other adaptive
  methods. We obtain more robust Markov chains, which often mix more quickly.
