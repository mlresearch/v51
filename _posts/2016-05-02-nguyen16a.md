title: New Resistance Distances with Global Information on Large Graphs
abstract: We consider the problem that on large random geometric graphs, random walk-based
  distances between nodes do not carry global information such as cluster structure.
  Instead, as the graphs become larger, the distances contain mainly the obsolete
  information of local density of the nodes. Many distances or similarity measures
  between nodes on a graph have been proposed but none are both proved to overcome
  this problem or computationally feasible even for small graphs. We propose new distance
  functions between nodes for this problem. The idea is to use electrical flows with
  different energy functions. Our proposed distances are proved analytically to be
  metrics in L^p spaces, to keep global information, avoiding the problem, and can
  be computed efficiently for large graphs. Our experiments with synthetic and real
  data confirmed the theoretical properties and practical performances of our proposed
  distances.
