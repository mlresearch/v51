title: Approximate Inference Using DC Programming For Collective Graphical Models
abstract: Collective graphical models (CGMs) provide a framework for reasoning about
  a population of independent and identically distributed individuals when only noisy
  and aggregate observations are given.  Previous approaches for inference in CGMs
  work on a junction-tree representation, thereby highly limiting their scalability.
  To remedy this, we show how the Bethe entropy approximation naturally arises for
  the inference problem in CGMs. We reformulate the resulting optimization problem
  as a difference-of-convex functions program that can capture different types of
  CGM noise models. Using the concave-convex procedure, we then develop a scalable
  message-passing algorithm. Empirically, our approach is highly scalable and accurate
  for large graphs, more than an order-of-magnitude faster than a generic optimization
  solver, and is guaranteed to converge unlike the previous message-passing approach
  NLBP that fails in several loopy graphs.
