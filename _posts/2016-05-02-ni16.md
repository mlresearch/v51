title: Optimal Statistical and Computational Rates for One Bit Matrix Completion
abstract: We consider one bit matrix completion under rank constraint. We present
  an estimator based on rank constrained maximum likelihood estimation, and an efficient
  greedy algorithm to solve it approximately based on an extension of conditional
  gradient descent. The output of the proposed algorithm converges at a linear rate
  to the underlying true low-rank matrix up to the optimal statistical estimation
  error rate, i.e., O(\sqrtrn\log(n)/|Ω|), where n is the dimension of the underlying
  matrix and |Ω| is the number of observed entries. Our work establishes the first
  computationally efficient approach with provable guarantee for optimal estimation
  in one bit matrix completion. Our theory is supported by thorough numerical results.
