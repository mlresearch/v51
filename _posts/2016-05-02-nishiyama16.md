title: The Nonparametric Kernel Bayes Smoother
abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made developing kernel mean expressions
  for Bayesian inference. An important success in this domain is the nonparametric
  kernel Bayes’ filter (nKB-filter), which can be used for sequential inference in
  state space models. We expand upon this work by introducing a smoothing algorithm,
  the nonparametric kernel Bayes’ smoother (nKB-smoother) which relies on kernel Bayesian
  inference through the kernel sum rule and kernel Bayes’ rule. We derive the smoothing
  equations, analyze the computational cost, and show smoothing consistency. We summarize
  the algorithm, which is simple to implement, requiring only matrix multiplications
  and the output of the nKB-filter. Finally, we report experimental results that compare
  the nKB-smoother to previous parametric and nonparametric approaches to Bayesian
  filtering and smoothing. In the supplementary materials, we show that the combination
  of the nKB-filter and  the nKB-smoother allows marginal kernel mean computation,
  which gives an  alternative to kernel belief propagation.
