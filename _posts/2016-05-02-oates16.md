title: Control Functionals for Quasi-Monte Carlo Integration
abstract: Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are being adopted in statistical applications
  due to the increasingly challenging nature of numerical integrals that are now routinely
  encountered. For integrands with d-dimensions and derivatives of order α, an optimal
  QMC rule converges at a best-possible rate O(N^-α/d). However, in applications the
  value of αcan be unknown and/or a rate-optimal QMC rule can be unavailable. Standard
  practice is to employ \alpha_L-optimal QMC where the lower bound \alpha_L ≤αis known,
  but in general this does not exploit the full power of QMC. One solution is to trade-off
  numerical integration with functional approximation. This strategy is explored herein
  and shown to be well-suited to modern statistical computation. A challenging application
  to robotic arm data demonstrates a substantial variance reduction in predictions
  for mechanical torques.
