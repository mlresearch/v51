title: Bayesian Nonparametric Kernel-Learning
abstract: Kernel methods are ubiquitous tools in machine learning. They have proven
  to be effective in many domains and tasks. Yet, kernel methods often require the
  user to select a predefined kernel to build an estimator with. However, there is
  often little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori. Even
  if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite sample
  estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore, when directly
  applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a N \times N Gram matrix
  of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of N instances. The computation
  of this Gram matrix precludes the direct application of kernel methods on large
  datasets, and makes kernel learning especially difficult. In this paper we introduce
  Bayesian nonparmetric kernel-learning (BaNK), a generic, data-driven framework for
  scalable learning of kernels. BaNK places a nonparametric prior on the spectral
  distribution of random frequencies allowing it to both learn kernels and scale to
  large datasets. We show that this framework can be used for large scale regression
  and classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that BaNK outperforms several other
  scalable approaches for kernel learning on a variety of real world datasets.
