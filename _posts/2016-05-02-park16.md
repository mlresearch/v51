title: 'K2-ABC: Approximate Bayesian Computation with Kernel Embeddings'
abstract: Complicated generative models often result in a situation where computing
  the likelihood of observed data is intractable, while simulating from the conditional
  density given a parameter value is relatively easy. Approximate Bayesian Computation
  (ABC) is a paradigm that enables simulation-based posterior inference in such cases
  by measuring the similarity between simulated and observed data in terms of a chosen
  set of summary statistics. However, there is no general rule to construct sufficient
  summary statistics for complex models. Insufficient summary statistics will leak
  information, which leads to ABC algorithms yielding samples from an incorrect  posterior.
  In this paper, we propose a fully nonparametric ABC paradigm which circumvents the
  need for manually selecting summary statistics. Our approach, K2-ABC,  uses maximum
  mean discrepancy (MMD) to construct a dissimilarity measure between the observed
  and simulated data. The embedding of an empirical distribution of the data into
  a reproducing kernel Hilbert space plays a role of the summary statistic and is
  sufficient whenever the corresponding kernels are characteristic. Experiments on
  a simulated scenario and a real-world biological problem illustrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed algorithm.
