title: On the Use of Non-Stationary Strategies for Solving Two-Player Zero-Sum Markov
  Games
abstract: 'The main contribution of this paper consists in extending several non-stationary
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and their theoretical guarantees to the case
  of γ-discounted zero-sum Markov Games (MGs). As in the case of Markov Decision Processes
  (MDPs), non-stationary algorithms are shown to exhibit better performance bounds
  compared to their stationary counterparts. The obtained bounds are generically composed
  of three terms: 1) a dependency on γ(discount factor), 2) a concentrability coefficient
  and 3) a propagation error term. This error, depending on the algorithm, can be
  caused by a regression step, a policy evaluation step or a best-response evaluation
  step. As a second contribution, we empirically demonstrate, on generic MGs (called
  Garnets), that non-stationary algorithms outperform their stationary counterparts.
  In addition, it is shown that their performance mostly depends on the nature of
  the propagation error. Indeed, algorithms where the error is due to the evaluation
  of a best-response are penalized (even if they exhibit better concentrability coefficients
  and dependencies on γ) compared to those suffering from a regression error.'
