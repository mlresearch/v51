title: A Deep Generative Deconvolutional Image Model
abstract: A deep generative model is developed for representation and analysis of
  images, based on a hierarchical convolutional dictionary-learning framework. Stochastic
  unpooling is employed to link consecutive layers in the model, yielding top-down
  image generation. A Bayesian support vector machine is linked to the top-layer features,
  yielding max-margin discrimination. Deep deconvolutional inference is employed when
  testing, to infer the latent features, and the top-layer features are connected
  with the max-margin classifier for discrimination tasks. The algorithm is efficiently
  trained via Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM), with implementation on
  graphical processor units (GPUs) for efficient large-scale learning, and fast testing.
  Excellent results are obtained on several benchmark datasets, including ImageNet,
  demonstrating that the proposed model achieves results that are highly competitive
  with similarly sized convolutional neural networks.
