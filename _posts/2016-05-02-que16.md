title: 'Back to the Future: Radial Basis Function Networks Revisited'
abstract: Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are a classical family of algorithms
  for supervised learning. The most popular approach for training RBF networks has
  relied on kernel methods using regularization based on a norm in a  Reproducing
  Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which is a principled and empirically successful framework.
  In this paper we aim to revisit some of the older approaches to training the RBF
  networks from a more modern perspective. Specifically, we analyze  two common regularization
  procedures, one based on the square norm of the coefficients in the network and
  another on using centers obtained by k-means clustering. We show that both of these
  RBF methods can be recast as certain data-dependent kernels. We provide a theoretical
  analysis of these methods as well as a number of experimental results, pointing
  out very competitive experimental performance as well as certain advantages over
  the standard kernel methods in terms of both flexibility (incorporating of unlabeled
  data)  and computational complexity.  Finally, our results shed light on some impressive
  recent successes  of  using soft k-means features for image recognition and other
  tasks.
