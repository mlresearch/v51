title: Low-Rank Approximation of Weighted Tree Automata
abstract: We describe a technique to minimize weighted tree automata (WTA), a powerful
  formalisms that subsumes probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) and latent-variable
  PCFGs. Our method relies on a singular value decomposition of the underlying Hankel
  matrix defined by the WTA. Our main theoretical result is an efficient algorithm
  for computing the SVD of an infinite Hankel matrix implicitly represented as a WTA.
  We evaluate our method on real-world data originating in newswire treebank. We show
  that the model achieves lower perplexity than previous methods for PCFG minimization,
  and also is much more stable due to the absence of local optima.
