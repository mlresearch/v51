title: Online and Distributed Bayesian Moment Matching for Parameter Learning in Sum-Product
  Networks
abstract: Probabilistic graphical models provide a general and flexible framework
  for reasoning about complex dependencies in noisy domains with many variables.  Among
  the various types of probabilistic graphical models, sum-product networks (SPNs)
  have recently generated some interest because exact inference can always be done
  in linear time with respect to the size of the network. This is particularly attractive
  since it means that learning an SPN from data always yields a tractable model for
  inference. However, existing parameter learning algorithms for SPNs operate in batch
  mode and do not scale easily to large datasets. In this work, we explore online
  algorithms to ensure that parameter learning can also be done tractably with respect
  to the amount of data.  More specifically, we propose a new Bayesian moment matching
  (BMM) algorithm that operates naturally in an online fashion and that can be easily
  distributed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of BMM in comparison
  to online extensions of gradient descent, exponentiated gradient and expectation
  maximization on 20 classic benchmarks and 4 large scale datasets.
