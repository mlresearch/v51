title: Large Scale Distributed Semi-Supervised Learning Using Streaming Approximation
abstract: Traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches are not
  suited for massive data and large label scenarios since they scale linearly with
  the number of edges |E| and distinct labels m. To deal with the large label size
  problem, recent works propose sketch-based methods to approximate the label distribution
  per node thereby achieving a space reduction from O(m) to O(\log m), under certain
  conditions. In this paper, we present a novel streaming graph-based SSL approximation
  that effectively captures the sparsity of the label distribution and further reduces
  the space complexity per node to O(1). We also provide a distributed version of
  the algorithm that scales well to large data sizes. Experiments on real-world datasets
  demonstrate that the new method achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art
  algorithms with significant reduction in memory footprint. Finally, we propose a
  robust graph augmentation strategy using unsupervised deep learning architectures
  that yields further significant quality gains for SSL in natural language applications.
