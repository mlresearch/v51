title: 'C3: Lightweight Incrementalized MCMC for Probabilistic Programs using Continuations
  and Callsite Caching'
abstract: 'Lightweight, source-to-source transformation approaches to implementing
  MCMC for probabilistic programming languages are popular for their simplicity, support
  of existing deterministic code, and ability to execute on existing fast runtimes.
  However, they are also inefficient, requiring a complete re-execution of the program
  on every Metropolis Hastings proposal. We present a new extension to the lightweight
  approach, C3, which enables efficient, incrementalized re-execution of MH proposals.
  C3 is based on two core ideas: transforming probabilistic programs into continuation
  passing style (CPS), and caching the results of function calls.  It is particularly
  effective at speeding up recursive programs with many local latent variables. We
  show that on several common models, C3 reduces proposal runtime by 20-100x, in some
  cases reducing runtime complexity from linear in model size to constant. We also
  demonstrate nearly an order of magnitude speedup on a complex inverse procedural
  modeling application.'
