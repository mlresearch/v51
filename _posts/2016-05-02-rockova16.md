title: Determinantal Regularization for Ensemble Variable Selection
abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in deterministic search approaches
  to spike-and-slab Bayesian variable selection. Such methods have focused on the
  goal of finding a global mode to identify a “best model”. However, the report of
  a single model will be a misleading reflection of the model uncertainty inherent
  in a highly multimodal posterior. Motivated by non-parametric variational Bayes
  strategies, we move beyond this limitation by  proposing an ensemble optimization
  approach to identify a collection of representative posterior modes. By deploying
  determinantal penalty functions as diversity regularizers, our approach performs
  regularization over multiple locations of the posterior. The key driver of these
  determinantal penalties is a kernel function that induces repulsion in the latent
  model space domain.
