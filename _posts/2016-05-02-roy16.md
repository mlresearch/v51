title: A Column Generation Bound Minimization Approach with PAC-Bayesian Generalization
  Guarantees
abstract: The C-bound, introduced in Lacasse et al (2006), gives a tight upper bound
  on the risk of the majority vote classifier. Laviolette et al. (2011) designed a
  learning algorithm named MinCq that outputs a dense distribution on a finite set
  of base classifiers by minimizing the C-bound, together with a PAC-Bayesian generalization
  guarantee. In this work, we design a column generation algorithm that we call CqBoost,
  that optimizes the C-bound and outputs a sparse distribution on a possibly infinite
  set of voters. We also propose a PAC-Bayesian bound for CqBoost that holds for finite
  and two cases of continuous sets of base classifiers. Finally, compare the accuracy
  and the sparsity of CqBoost with MinCq and other state-of-the-art boosting algorithms.
