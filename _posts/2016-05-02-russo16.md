title: Controlling Bias in Adaptive Data Analysis Using Information Theory
abstract: Modern big data settings often involve messy, high-dimensional data, where
  it is not clear a priori what are the right questions to ask. To extract the most
  insights from a dataset, the analyst typically needs to engage in an iterative process
  of adaptive data analysis. The choice of analytics to be performed next depends
  on the results of the previous analyses on the same data. It is commonly recognized
  that such adaptivity (also called researcher degrees of freedom), even if well-intentioned,
  can lead to false discoveries, contributing to the crisis of reproducibility in
  science. In this paper, we propose a general information-theoretic framework to
  quantify and provably bound the bias of arbitrary adaptive analysis process. We
  prove that our mutual information based bound is tight in natural models. We show
  how this framework can give rigorous insights into when commonly used feature selection
  protocols (e.g. rank selection) do and do not lead to biased estimation. We also
  show how recent insights from differential privacy emerge from this framework when
  the analyst is assumed to be adversarial, though our bounds applies in more general
  settings. We illustrate our results with simple simulations.
