title: Graph Sparsification Approaches for  Laplacian Smoothing
abstract: 'Given a statistical estimation problem where regularization is performed
  according to the structure of a large, dense graph G, we consider fitting the statistical
  estimate using a \it sparsified surrogate graph \mathbfG, which shares the vertices
  of G but has far fewer edges, and is thus more tractable to work with computationally.
  We examine three types of sparsification: spectral sparsification, which can be
  seen as the result of sampling edges from the graph with probabilities proportional
  to their effective resistances, and two simpler sparsifiers, which sample edges
  uniformly from the graph, either globally or locally.  We provide strong theoretical
  and experimental results, demonstrating that sparsification before estimation can
  give statistically sensible solutions, with significant computational savings.'
