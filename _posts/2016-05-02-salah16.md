title: Model-based Co-clustering for High Dimensional Sparse Data
abstract: We propose a novel model based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
  for co-clustering high dimensional sparse matrices. While existing vMF-based models
  are only suitable for clustering along one dimension, our model acts simultaneously
  on both dimensions of a data matrix. Thereby it has the advantage of exploiting
  the inherent duality between rows and columns. Setting our model under the maximum
  likelihood (ML) approach and the classification ML (CML) approach, we derive two
  novel, hard and soft, co-clustering algorithms. Empirical results on numerous synthetic
  and real-world text datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, for
  modelling high dimensional sparse data and co-clustering. Furthermore, thanks to
  our formulation, that performs an implicitly adaptive dimensionality reduction at
  each stage, our model alleviates the problem of high concentration parameters kappaâ€™s,
  a well known difficulty in the classical vMF-based models.
