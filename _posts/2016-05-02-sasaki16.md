title: Non-Gaussian Component Analysis with Log-Density Gradient Estimation
abstract: Non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) is aimed at identifying a linear
  subspace such that the projected data follows a non-Gaussian distribution. In this
  paper, we propose a novel NGCA algorithm based on log-density gradient estimation.
  Unlike existing methods, the proposed NGCA algorithm identifies the linear subspace
  by using the eigenvalue decomposition without any iterative procedures, and thus
  is computationally reasonable. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we prove
  that the identified subspace converges to the true subspace at the optimal parametric
  rate. Finally, the practical performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated
  on both artificial and benchmark datasets.
