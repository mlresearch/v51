title: Chained Gaussian Processes
abstract: 'Gaussian process models are flexible, Bayesian non-parametric approaches
  to regression. Properties of multivariate Gaussians mean that they can be combined
  linearly in the manner of additive models and via a link function (like in generalized
  linear models) to handle non-Gaussian data. However, the link function formalism
  is restrictive, link functions are always invertible and must convert a parameter
  of interest to an linear combination of the underlying processes. There are many
  likelihoods and models where a non-linear combination is more appropriate. We term
  these more general models "Chained Gaussian Processes": the transformation of the
  GPs to the likelihood parameters will not generally be invertible, and that implies
  that linearisation would only be possible with multiple (localized) links, i.e a
  chain. We develop an approximate inference procedure for Chained GPs that is scalable
  and applicable to any factorized likelihood. We demonstrate the approximation on
  a range of likelihood functions.'
