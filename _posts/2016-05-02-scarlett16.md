title: Limits on Sparse Support Recovery via Linear Sketching with Random Expander
  Matrices
abstract: Linear sketching is a powerful tool for the problem of sparse signal recovery,
  having numerous applications such as compressive sensing, data stream computing,
  graph sketching, and routing.  Motivated by applications where the \emphpositions
  of the non-zero entries in a sparse vector are of primary interest, we consider
  the problem of \emphsupport recovery from a linear sketch taking the form \mathbfY
  = \mathbfXβ+ \mathbfZ.  We focus on a widely-used expander-based construction in
  the columns of the measurement matrix \mathbfX ∈\mathbbR^n \times p are random permutations
  of a sparse binary vector containing d ≪n ones and n-d zeros.  We provide a sharp
  characterization of the number of measurements required for an information-theoretically
  optimal decoder, thus permitting a precise comparison to the i.i.d. Gaussian construction.  Our
  findings reveal both positive and negative results, showing that the performance
  nearly matches the Gaussian construction at moderate-to-high noise levels, while
  being worse by an arbitrarily large factor at low noise levels.
