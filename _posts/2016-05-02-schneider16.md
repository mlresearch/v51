title: Probability Inequalities for Kernel Embeddings in Sampling without Replacement
abstract: The \emphkernel embedding of distributions is a popular machine learning
  technique to manipulate probability distributions and an integral part of numerous
  applications. Its empirical counterpart is an estimate from a finite dataset of
  samples from the distribution under consideration. However, for large-scale learning
  problems the empirical kernel embedding becomes infeasible to compute and approximate,
  constant time, solutions are necessary. Instead of the full dataset, a random subset
  of smaller size can be used to calculate the empirical kernel embedding, known as
  \emphsampling without replacement. In this work we generalize the results of (Serfling
  1974) to quantify the difference between this two estimates. We derive probability
  inequalities for the kernel embedding and more general inequalities for Banach space
  valued martingales in the setting of sampling without replacement.
