title: Tractable and Scalable Schatten Quasi-Norm Approximations for Rank Minimization
abstract: The Schatten quasi-norm was introduced to bridge the gap between the trace
  norm and rank function. However, existing algorithms are too slow or even impractical
  for large-scale problems. Motivated by the equivalence relation between the trace
  norm and its bilinear spectral penalty, we define two tractable Schatten norms,
  i.e. the bi-trace and tri-trace norms, and prove that they are in essence the Schatten-1/2
  and 1/3 quasi-norms, respectively. By applying the two defined Schatten quasi-norms
  to various rank minimization problems such as MC and RPCA, we only need to solve
  much smaller factor matrices. We design two efficient linearized alternating minimization
  algorithms to solve our problems and establish that each bounded sequence generated
  by our algorithms converges to a critical point. We also provide the restricted
  strong convexity (RSC) based and MC error bounds for our algorithms. Our experimental
  results verified both the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms compared
  with the state-of-the-art methods.
