title: Learning Structured Low-Rank Representation via Matrix Factorization
abstract: A vast body of recent works in the literature has shown that exploring structures
  beyond data low-rankness can boost the performance of subspace clustering methods
  such as Low-Rank Representation (LRR). It has also been well recognized that the
  matrix factorization framework might offer more flexibility on pursuing underlying
  structures of the data. In this paper, we propose to learn structured LRR by factorizing
  the nuclear norm regularized matrix, which leads to our proposed non-convex formulation
  NLRR.  Interestingly, this formulation of NLRR provides a general framework for
  unifying a variety of popular algorithms including LRR, dictionary learning, robust
  principal component analysis, sparse subspace clustering, etc. Several variants
  of NLRR are also proposed, for example, to promote sparsity while preserving low-rankness.
  We design a practical algorithm for NLRR and its variants, and establish theoretical
  guarantee for the stability of the solution and the convergence of the algorithm.
  Perhaps surprisingly, the  computational and memory cost of NLRR can be reduced  by
  roughly one order of magnitude compared to the cost of LRR. Experiments on extensive
  simulations and real datasets confirm the robustness of efficiency of NLRR and the
  variants.
