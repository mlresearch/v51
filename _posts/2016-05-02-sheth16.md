title: A Fixed-Point Operator for Inference in Variational Bayesian Latent Gaussian
  Models
abstract: Latent Gaussian Models (LGM) provide a rich modeling framework with general
  inference procedures. The variational approximation offers an effective solution
  for such models and has attracted a significant amount of interest. Recent work
  proposed a fixed-point (FP) update procedure to optimize the covariance matrix in
  the variational solution and demonstrated its efficacy in specific models. The paper
  makes three contributions. First, it shows that the same approach can be used more
  generally in extensions of LGM. Second, it  provides an analysis identifying conditions
  for the convergence of the FP method. Third, it provides an extensive experimental
  evaluation in Gaussian processes, sparse Gaussian processes, and generalized linear
  models, with several non-conjugate observation likelihoods, showing wide applicability
  of the FP method and a significant advantage over gradient based optimization.
