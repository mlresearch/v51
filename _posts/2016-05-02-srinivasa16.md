title: Survey Propagation beyond Constraint Satisfaction Problems
abstract: Survey propagation (SP) is a message passing procedure that attempts to
  model all the fixed points of Belief Propagation (BP), thereby improving BP’s approximation
  in loopy graphs where BP’s assumptions do not hold. For this, SP messages represent
  distributions over BP messages. Unfortunately this requirement makes SP intractable
  beyond constraint satisfaction problems because, to perform general SP updates,
  one has to operate on distributions over a continuous domain. We propose an approximation
  scheme to efficiently extend the application of SP to marginalization in binary
  pairwise graphical models. Our approximate SP has O(DK\log(DK)t) complexity per
  iteration, where t is the complexity of BP per iteration, D is the maximum node
  degree and K is a resolution constant controlling the approximation’s fidelity.
  Our experiments show that this method can track many BP fixed points, achieving
  a high marginalization accuracy within a few iterations, in difficult settings where
  BP is often non-convergent and inaccurate.
