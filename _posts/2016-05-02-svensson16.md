title: Computationally Efficient Bayesian Learning of Gaussian Process State Space
  Models
abstract: Gaussian processes allow for flexible specification of prior assumptions
  of unknown dynamics in state space models. We present a procedure for efficient
  Bayesian learning in Gaussian process state space models, where the representation
  is formed by projecting the problem onto a set of approximate eigenfunctions derived
  from the prior covariance structure. Learning under this family of models can be
  conducted using a carefully crafted particle MCMC algorithm. This scheme is computationally
  efficient and yet allows for a fully Bayesian treatment of the problem. Compared
  to conventional system identification tools or existing learning methods, we show
  competitive performance and reliable quantification of uncertainties in the model.
