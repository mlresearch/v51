title: Bethe Learning of Graphical Models via MAP Decoding
abstract: Many machine learning tasks require fitting probabilistic models over structured
  objects, such as pixel grids, matchings, and graph edges. Maximum likelihood estimation
  (MLE) for such domains is challenging due to the intractability of computing partition
  functions. One can resort to approximate marginal inference in conjunction with
  gradient descent, but such algorithms require careful tuning. Alternatively, in
  frameworks such as the structured support vector machine (SVM-Struct), discriminative
  functions are learned by iteratively applying efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP)
  decoders. We introduce MLE-Struct, a method for learning discrete exponential family
  models using the Bethe approximation to the partition function. Remarkably, this
  problem can also be reduced to iterative (MAP) decoding. This connection emerges
  by combining the Bethe approximation with the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm on a convex
  dual objective, which circumvents the intractable partition function. Our method
  can learn both generative and conditional models and is substantially faster and
  easier to implement than existing MLE approaches while still relying on the same
  black-box interface to MAP decoding as SVM-Struct. We perform competitively on problems
  in denoising, segmentation, matching, and new datasets of roommate assignments and
  news and financial time series.
