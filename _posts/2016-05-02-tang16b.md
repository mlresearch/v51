title: 'On Lloyd''s Algorithm: New Theoretical Insights for Clustering in Practice'
abstract: We provide new analyses of Lloyd’s algorithm (1982), commonly known as the
  k-means clustering algorithm. Kumar and Kannan (2010) showed that running k-SVD
  followed by a constant approximation k-means algorithm, and then Lloyd’s algorithm,
  will correctly cluster nearly all of the dataset with respect to the optimal clustering,
  provided the dataset satisfies a deterministic clusterability assumption. This method
  is viewed as the "Swiss Army knife" for clustering problems, subsuming popular generative
  models such as Gaussian mixtures. However, it is tailored to high dimensional data,
  i.e., when d ≫k . We analyze Lloyd’s algorithm for general d without using the spectral
  projection, which leads to a weaker assumption in the case d < k. Surprisingly,
  we show that a simple and scalable heuristic that combines random sampling with
  Single-Linkage serves as a good seeding algorithm for Lloyd’s algorithm under this
  assumption. We then study stopping criteria for Lloyd’s algorithm under the lens
  of clusterability, accompanied by controlled simulations.
