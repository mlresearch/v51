title: Spectral M-estimation with Applications to Hidden Markov Models
abstract: Method of moment estimators exhibit appealing statistical properties, such
  as asymptotic unbiasedness, for nonconvex problems. However, they typically require
  a large number of samples and are extremely sensitive to model misspecification.
  In this paper, we apply the framework of M-estimation to develop both a generalized
  method of moments procedure and a principled method for regularization. Our proposed
  M-estimator obtains optimal sample efficiency rates (in the class of moment-based
  estimators) and the same well-known rates on prediction accuracy as other spectral
  estimators. It also makes it straightforward to incorporate regularization into
  the sample moment conditions. We demonstrate empirically the gains in sample efficiency
  from our approach on hidden Markov models.
