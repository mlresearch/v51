title: Learning Sparse Additive Models with Interactions in High Dimensions
abstract: 'A function f: \mathbbR^d →\mathbbR is referred to as a Sparse Additive
  Model (SPAM), if it is of the form f(x) = \sum_l ∈S \phi_l(x_l), where S ⊂[d], |S|
  ≪d. Assuming \phi_l’s and S to be unknown, the problem of estimating f from its
  samples has been studied extensively. In this work, we consider a generalized SPAM,
  allowing for second order interaction terms. For some S_1 ⊂[d], S_2 ⊂[d] \choose
  2, the function f is assumed to be of the form:  f(x) = \sum_p ∈S_1 \phi_p (x_p)
  + \sum_(l,l’) ∈S_2 \phi_l,l’ (x_l, x_l’). Assuming \phi_p, \phi_(l,l’), S_1 and
  S_2 to be unknown, we provide a randomized algorithm that queries f and exactly
  recovers S_1,S_2. Consequently, this also enables us to estimate the underlying
  \phi_p, \phi_l,l’. We derive sample complexity bounds for our scheme and also extend
  our analysis to include the situation where the queries are corrupted with noise
  – either stochastic,  or arbitrary but bounded. Lastly, we provide simulation results
  on synthetic data, that validate our theoretical findings.'
