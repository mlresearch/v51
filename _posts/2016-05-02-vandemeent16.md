title: Black-Box Policy Search with Probabilistic Programs
abstract: 'In this work we show how to represent policies as programs: that is, as
  stochastic simulators with tunable parameters.  To learn the parameters of such
  policies we develop connections between black box variational inference and existing
  policy search approaches.  We then explain how such learning can be implemented
  in a probabilistic programming system.  Using our own novel implementation of such
  a system we demonstrate both conciseness of policy representation and automatic
  policy parameter learning for a set of canonical reinforcement learning problems.'
