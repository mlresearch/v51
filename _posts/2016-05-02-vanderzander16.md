title: On Searching for Generalized Instrumental Variables
abstract: Instrumental Variables  are a popular way to identify the direct causal
  effect of a random variable X on a variable Y.  Often no single instrumental variable
  exists, although it is still possible to find a set of generalized instrumental
  variables (GIVs) and identify the causal effect of all these variables at once.  Till
  now it was not known how to find GIVs systematically or even test efficiently, if
  given variables satisfy GIV conditions.  We provide fast algorithms for searching
  and testing restricted cases of GIVs.  However, we prove that in the most general
  case it is NP-hard to verify if given variables fulfill the conditions of a general
  instrumental sets.
