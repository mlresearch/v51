title: Precision Matrix Estimation in High Dimensional Gaussian Graphical Models with
  Faster Rates
abstract: In this paper, we present a new estimator for precision matrix in high dimensional
  Gaussian graphical models. At the core of the proposed estimator is a collection
  of node-wise linear regression with nonconvex penalty. In contrast to existing estimators
  for Gaussian graphical models with O(s\sqrt\log d/n) estimation error bound in terms
  of spectral norm, where s is the maximum degree of a graph, the proposed estimator
  could attain O(s/\sqrtn+\sqrt\log d/n) spectral norm based convergence rate in the
  best case, and it is no worse than exiting estimators in general. In addition, our
  proposed estimator enjoys the oracle property under a milder condition than existing
  estimators. We show through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets
  that our estimator outperforms the state-of-the art estimators.
