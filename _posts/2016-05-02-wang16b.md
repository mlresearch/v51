title: Graph Connectivity in Noisy Sparse Subspace Clustering
abstract: Subspace clustering is the problem of clustering data points into a union
  of low-dimensional linear/affine subspaces. It is the mathematical abstraction of
  many important problems in computer vision, image processing and machine learning.
  A line of recent work [4, 19, 24, 20] provided strong theoretical guarantee for
  sparse subspace cluster- ing [4], the state-of-the-art algorithm for sub- space
  clustering, on both noiseless and noisy data sets. It was shown that under mild
  conditions, with high probability no two points from different subspaces are clustered
  together. Such guarantee, however, is not sufficient for the clustering to be correct,
  due to the notorious “graph connectivity problem” [15]. In this paper, we investigate
  the graph connectivity problem for noisy sparse sub-space clustering and show that
  a simple post-processing procedure is capable of delivering consistent clustering
  under certain “general position” or “restricted eigenvalue” assumptions. We also
  show that our condition is almost tight with adversarial noise perturbation by constructing
  a counter-example. These results provide the first exact clustering guarantee of
  noisy SSC for subspaces of dimension greater then 3.
