title: Sequential Inference for Deep Gaussian Process
abstract: A deep Gaussian process (DGP) is a deep network in which each layer is modelled
  with a Gaussian process (GP). It is a flexible model that can capture highly-nonlinear
  functions for complex data sets. However, the network structure of DGP often makes
  inference computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient sequential
  inference framework for DGP, where the data is processed sequentially. We also propose
  two DGP extensions to handle heteroscedasticity and multi-task learning. Our experimental
  evaluation shows the effectiveness of  our sequential inference framework on a number
  of important learning tasks.
