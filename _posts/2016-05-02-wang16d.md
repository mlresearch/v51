title: Distributed Multi-Task Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of distributed multi-task learning, where each machine
  learns a separate, but related, task. Specifically, each machine learns a linear
  predictor in high-dimensional space, where all tasks share the same small support.
  We present a communication-efficient estimator based on the debiased lasso and show
  that it is comparable with the optimal centralized method.
