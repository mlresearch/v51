title: Scalable geometric density estimation
abstract: It is standard to assume a low-dimensional structure in estimating a high-dimensional
  density.  However, popular methods, such as probabilistic principal component analysis,
  scale poorly computationally. We introduce a novel empirical Bayes method that we
  term geometric density estimation (GEODE) and show that, with mild conditions and
  among all d-dimensional linear subspaces, the span of the d leading principal axes
  of the data maximizes the model posterior. With these axes pre-computed using fast
  singular value decomposition, GEODE easily scales to high dimensional problems while
  providing uncertainty characterization. The model is also capable of imputing missing
  data and dynamically deleting redundant dimensions. Finally, we generalize GEODE
  by mixing it across a dyadic clustering tree. Both simulation studies and real world
  data applications show superior performance of GEODE in terms of robustness and
  computational efficiency.
