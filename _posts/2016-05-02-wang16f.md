title: Optimization as Estimation with Gaussian Processes in Bandit Settings
abstract: 'Recently, there has been rising interest in Bayesian optimization â€“ the
  optimization of an unknown function with assumptions usually expressed by a Gaussian
  Process (GP) prior. We study an optimization strategy that directly uses an estimate
  of the argmax of the function. This strategy offers both practical and theoretical
  advantages: no tradeoff parameter needs to be selected, and, moreover, we establish
  close connections to the popular GP-UCB and GP-PI strategies. Our approach can be
  understood as automatically and adaptively trading off exploration and exploitation
  in GP-UCB and GP-PI. We illustrate the effects of this adaptive tuning via bounds
  on the regret as well as an extensive empirical evaluation on robotics and vision
  tasks, demonstrating the robustness of this strategy for a range of performance
  criteria.'
