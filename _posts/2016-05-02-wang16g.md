title: Inference for High-dimensional Exponential Family Graphical Models
abstract: Probabilistic graphical models have been widely used to model complex systems
  and aid scientific discoveries. Most existing work on high-dimensional estimation
  of exponential family graphical models, including Gaussian graphical models and
  Ising models, is focused on consistent model selection. However, these results do
  not characterize uncertainty in the estimated structure and are of limited value
  to scientists who worry whether their findings will be reproducible and if the estimated
  edges are present in the model due to random chance. In this paper, we propose a
  novel estimator for edge parameters in an exponential family graphical models. We
  prove that the estimator is \sqrtn-consistent and asymptotically Normal.  This result
  allows us to construct confidence intervals for edge parameters, as well as, hypothesis
  tests. We establish our results under conditions that are typically assumed in the
  literature for consistent estimation. However, we do not require that the estimator
  consistently recovers the graph structure. In particular, we prove that the asymptotic
  distribution of the estimator is robust to model selection mistakes and uniformly
  valid for a large number of data-generating processes. We illustrate validity of
  our estimator through extensive simulation studies.
