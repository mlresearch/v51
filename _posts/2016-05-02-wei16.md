title: Unsupervised Feature Selection by Preserving Stochastic Neighbors
abstract: Feature selection is an important technique for alleviating the curse of
  dimensionality. Unsupervised feature selection is more challenging than its supervised
  counterpart due to the lack of labels. In this paper, we present an effective method,
  Stochastic Neighbor-preserving Feature Selection (SNFS), for selecting discriminative
  features in unsupervised setting. We employ the concept of stochastic neighbors
  and select the features that can best preserve such stochastic neighbors by minimizing
  the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between neighborhood distributions. The proposed
  approach measures feature utility jointly in a non-linear way and discriminative
  features can be selected due to its ’push-pull’ property. We develop an efficient
  algorithm for optimizing the objective function based on projected quasi-Newton
  method. Moreover, few existing methods provide ways for determining the optimal
  number of selected features and this hampers their utility in practice. Our approach
  is equipped with a guideline for choosing the number of features, which provides
  nearly optimal performance in our experiments. Experimental results show that the
  proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly on several real-world
  datasets.
