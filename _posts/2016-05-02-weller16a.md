title: Clamping Improves TRW and Mean Field Approximations
abstract: We examine the effect of clamping variables for approximate inference in
  undirected graphical models with pairwise relationships and discrete variables.
  For any number of variable labels, we demonstrate that clamping and summing approximate
  sub-partition functions can lead only to a decrease in the partition function estimate
  for TRW, and an increase for the naive mean Ô¨Åeld method, in each case guaranteeing
  an improvement in the approximation and bound. We next focus on binary variables,
  add the Bethe approximation to consideration and examine ways to choose good variables
  to clamp, introducing new methods. We show the importance of identifying highly
  frustrated cycles, and of checking the singleton entropy of a variable. We explore
  the value of our methods by empirical analysis and draw lessons to guide practitioners.
