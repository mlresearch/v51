title: Tightness of LP Relaxations for Almost Balanced Models
abstract: Linear programming (LP) relaxations are widely used to attempt to identify
  a most likely conﬁguration of a discrete graphical model. In some cases, the LP
  relaxation attains an optimum vertex at an integral location and thus guarantees
  an exact solution to the original optimization problem. When this occurs, we say
  that the LP relaxation is tight. Here we consider binary pairwise models and derive
  sufﬁcient conditions for guaranteed tightness of (i) the standard LP relaxation
  on the local polytope LP+LOC, and (ii) the LP relaxation on the triplet-consistent
  polytope LP+TRI (the next level in the Sherali-Adams hierarchy). We provide simple
  new proofs of earlier results and derive significant novel results including that
  LP+TRI is tight for any model where each block is balanced or almost balanced, and
  a decomposition theorem that may be used to break apart complex models into smaller
  pieces. An almost balanced (sub-)model is one that contains no frustrated cycles
  except through one privileged variable.
