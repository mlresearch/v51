title: Relationship between PreTraining and Maximum Likelihood Estimation in Deep
  Boltzmann Machines
abstract: A pretraining algorithm, which is a layer-by-layer greedy learning algorithm,
  for a deep Boltzmann machine (DBM) is presented in this paper.  By considering the
  deep belief net type of pretraining for the DBM, which is a simplified version of
  the original pretraining of the DBM,  two interesting theoretical facts about pretraining
  can be obtained.   (1) By applying two different types of approximation, a replacing
  approximation by using a Bayesian network  and a Bethe type of approximation based
  on the cluster variation method, to two different parts of the true log-likelihood
  function of the DBM, pretraining can be derived from a variational approximation
  of the original maximum likelihood estimation.  (2) It can be ensured that the pretraining
  improves the variational bound of the true log-likelihood function of the DBM.  These
  two theoretical results will help deepen our understanding of deep learning.  Moreover,
  on the basis of the theoretical results, we discuss the original pretraining of
  the DBM in the latter part of this paper.
