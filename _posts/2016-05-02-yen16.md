title: Scalable Exemplar Clustering and Facility Location via Augmented Block Coordinate
  Descent with Column Generation
abstract: In recent years exemplar clustering has become a popular tool for applications
  in document and video summarization, active learning, and  clustering with general
  similarity, where cluster centroids are required to be a subset of the data samples
  rather than their linear combinations. The problem is also well-known as facility
  location in the operations research literature. While the problem has well-developed
  convex relaxation with approximation and recovery guarantees, it has number of variables
  grows quadratically with the number of samples. Therefore, state-of-the-art methods
  can hardly handle more than 10^4 samples (i.e. 10^8 variables). In this  work, we
  propose an Augmented-Lagrangian with Block Coordinate  Descent (AL-BCD) algorithm
  that utilizes problem structure to obtain closed-form solution for each block sub-problem,
  and exploits low-rank representation of the dissimilarity matrix to search  active
  columns without computing the entire matrix. Experiments show our approach to be
  orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches and can handle problems of up
  to 10^6 samples. We also demonstrate successful applications of the algorithm on
  world-scale facility location, document summarization and active learning.
