title: A Convex Surrogate Operator for General Non-Modular Loss Functions
abstract: Empirical risk minimization frequently employs convex surrogates to underlying
  discrete loss functions in order to achieve computational tractability during optimization.
  However, classical convex surrogates can only tightly bound modular loss functions,
  submodular functions or supermodular functions separately while maintaining polynomial
  time computation. In this work, a novel generic convex surrogate for general non-modular
  loss functions is introduced, which provides for the first time a tractable solution
  for loss functions that are neither supermodular nor submodular. This convex surrogate
  is based on a submodular-supermodular decomposition for which the existence and
  uniqueness is proven in this paper. It takes the sum of two convex surrogates that
  separately bound the supermodular component and the submodular component using slack-rescaling
  and the Lovasz hinge, respectively. It is further proven that this surrogate is
  convex, piecewise linear, an extension of the loss function, and for which subgradient
  computation is polynomial time. Empirical results are reported on a non-submodular
  loss based on the Sorensen-Dice difference function, and a real-world face track
  dataset with tens of thousands of frames, demonstrating the improved performance,
  efficiency, and scalability of the novel convex surrogate.
