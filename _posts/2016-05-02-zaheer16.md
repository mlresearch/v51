title: Exponential Stochastic Cellular Automata for Massively Parallel Inference
abstract: We propose an embarrassingly parallel, memory efficient inference algorithm
  for latent variable models in which the complete data likelihood is in the exponential
  family. The algorithm is a stochastic cellular automaton and converges to a valid
  maximum a posteriori fixed point. Applied to latent Dirichlet allocation we find
  that our algorithm is over an order or magnitude faster than the fastest current
  approaches. A simple C++/MPI implementation on a 20-node Amazon EC2 cluster samples
  at more than 1 billion tokens per second. We process 3 billion documents and achieve
  predictive power competitive with collapsed Gibbs sampling and variational inference.
