title: 'Online (and Offline) Robust PCA: Novel Algorithms and Performance Guarantees'
abstract: In this work we develop and study a novel online robust principal componentsâ€™
  analysis (RPCA) algorithm based on the recently introduced ReProCS framework. Our
  algorithm significantly improves upon the original ReProCS algorithm and it also
  returns even more accurate offline estimates. The key contribution of this work
  is a correctness result for this algorithm under relatively mild assumptions. By
  using extra (but usually valid) assumptions we are able to remove one important
  limitation of batch RPCA results and two important limitations of a recent result
  for ReProCS for online RPCA. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
  first correctness results for online RPCA.
