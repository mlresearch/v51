title: Stochastic Variational Inference for the HDP-HMM
abstract: We derive a variational inference algorithm for the HDP-HMM based on the
  two-level stick breaking construction. This construction has previously been applied
  to the hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDP) for mixed membership models, allowing
  for efficient handling of the coupled weight parameters. However, the same algorithm
  is not directly applicable to HDP-based infinite hidden Markov models (HDP-HMM)
  because of extra sequential dependencies in the Markov chain. In this paper we provide
  a solution to this problem by deriving a variational inference algorithm for the
  HDP-HMM, as well as its stochastic extension, for which all parameter updates are
  in closed form. We apply our algorithm to sequential text analysis and audio signal
  analysis, comparing our results with the beam-sampled iHMM, the parametric HMM,
  and other variational inference approximations.
