title: On Convergence of Model Parallel Proximal Gradient Algorithm for Stale Synchronous
  Parallel System
abstract: With ever growing data volume and model size, an error-tolerant, communication
  efficient, yet versatile parallel algorithm has become a vital part for the success
  of many large-scale applications. In this work we propose mspg, an extension of
  the flexible proximal gradient algorithm to the model parallel and stale synchronous
  setting. The worker machines of mspg operate asynchronously as long as they are
  not too far apart, and they communicate efficiently through a dedicated parameter
  server. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous analysis of the various convergence
  properties of mspg, and a salient feature of our analysis is its seamless generality
  that allows both nonsmooth and nonconvex functions. Under mild conditions, we prove
  the whole iterate sequence of mspg converges to a critical point (which is optimal
  under convexity assumptions). We further provide an economical implementation of
  mspg, completely bypassing the need of keeping a local full model. We confirm our
  theoretical findings through numerical experiments.
